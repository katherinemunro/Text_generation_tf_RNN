5 ways to be remarkable  even if you don’t shower before noon   look around  are there dishes in your sink  toys on the floor  laundry in the dryer ready to be put away   i’m not asking because i’m judging you  in fact  quite the opposite  my house is never as clean as i want it to be  because inevitably  minutes after cleaning  someone gets into a project  and it’s usually a messy one   at the end of the week  i’m exhausted from work and only interested in unwinding on the porch with a glass of wine  and most weeks  i’ll look back and realize i only did half of what i wanted to do   it’s so easy to be hard on ourselves  our brains are hard wired to remember the bad and forget the good  couple that with the physical manifestation of a to-do list that is impossible to finish  and you’ve got a recipe for making yourself feel bad about everything you didn’t get to   what if we turned that around  what if  instead of focusing on all the things we wanted to accomplish and didn’t  we looked at all we did do and saw just how remarkable we are   because even though you might not realize it  you are doing remarkable things  i’m sure some days  heck  some weeks   don’t feel remarkable and you feel like ordinary is a stretch goal  but you can be more remarkable  here’s five ways to get you started   1  define what “remarkable” means to you  in order to add magic to your life  you have to define what it means to live remarkably  does that mean having a clean house every week  working toward health or financial goals  when you think about adding bits of remarkability into your life  what are you envisioning   for me  it means finishing tasks i start and following through on some of my more crazy-sounding ideas  it means walking the dog and making sure he gets enough exercise every day  it means working smarter  not harder  so i can spend more quality time with the people i love instead of doing extra work when i’m with my family   2  start making notes on the things you were able to do  this week  take out a blank piece of paper and split it into boxes  then  track accomplishments in the following categories   fitness  are you training for a race  how’s it going  did you play tennis outside  ride your bike  do yoga  finance  did you make an extra debt payment or hit a savings target  did you avoid buying something you wanted  but didn’t need  projects  how are your crafts going  what about your blog  are you developing an app  knitting a scarf  what did you finish this week  what are you working on  best meals  use this section to make note of the things you loved to eat this week  restaurant meals  meals cooked at home  meals prepared for you at a friend’s house  refer to this section when you get stuck in a cooking rut later in the year  work  we spend so much of our lives at work  what did you get done this week  did you nail a presentation  get a compliment from a colleague  get asked to speak at a conference  family  family is so important  and so easily neglected  make a point to be more present to the people you love most of all  what’s going on in their lives  what did you do together  take good notes in this section  as it will prove to be the most valuable as time goes on  fun  if you can’t have a good time  what’s the point of it all  make sure you’re able to mark at least one thing down each week in the fun category  social  did you make it to happy hour  that’s both fun and social  twofer  which friends did you see  at at the end of the week  you can look back and see all the things you did  it’s such a rush to look back on a week where you really didn’t feel like you did much more than make sure everyone ate  something  and got to bed every night   3  give yourself credit for unremarkable things  okay  this will feel a little silly  but in order to get into the spirit of things  start writing down everything you’re accomplishing   this is the modern-day equivalent of writing “create to-do list” on your to-do list in order to have something to cross off    but let’s say you’re focusing on your fitness  every time you drink a glass of water instead of a soda  write it down  or if you’re trying to curb your spending  every time you pass by something that was adorable  but didn’t help with your goals  write that down   me  i’m getting back into running  so i’d like to start running about five miles a week  the old me would have put “run five miles” on a to-do list  which is daunting since i can’t do it all at once without wanting to lay down on the street and gasp for breath   but the new me  the new me just wrote  “monday  ran 1 25 miles without stopping or walking ” on my piece of paper  if you’re even a little bit athletic  that is not an accomplishment  but if you’re just getting back into running after  ahem  eight months off  you’re darn proud of that  tomorrow  i’ll see it and it’ll compel me to lace up my shoes and run the same route  and before i know it  that five mile goal will be met  exceeded  even     4  aim high er   when i say “aim higher ” i don’t mean “cram as much as you can into one single solitary week” because we both know that’s a to-do list of things you won’t actually ever do  i mean think beyond the week  let’s say you want to accomplish something by christmas — maybe you want to create your own christmas cards or write a book or run a half marathon  those are the big goals i’m talking about  they should be things that you simply cannot do right now  but that you can work every day toward and see a huge return by the end of the year   i’d like to lose a little weight  hey  wouldn’t we all   but i’m not going to write “lose 12 pounds” on my big-goal list  why  because that’s a negative goal  and one where i can track it every day and berate myself when the scale doesn’t move every time i opt for a salad over french fries  instead  i’m going to go with something i want to gain  i’d like to be able to run 10 miles without stopping or walking by christmas  today i went 1 25 miles  next month i’ll run 2 5 miles  i’ll keep increasing my distance  and by christmas  i know i will be able to run 10 miles without stopping   5  rearrange your to-do list  okay  so we’ve agreed that we’re going to do great things by christmas  and we’re going to keep track of every little  and not-so-little  thing we’ve accomplished each week  but we still have that to-do list  right   well  sure  i still write a to-do list every day on a blank piece of paper and cross things off as i get them done  but i don’t have the ridiculous unattainable goals on the daily list anymore  instead  i’m choosing to set big goals  then track progress as i go   it’s made me so much more productive  and writing down the big and little things makes everything tangible  in fact  i’ve created something physical that helps with this  it’s called the remarkable year  and it’s on kickstarter right here 6 times i ve ignored my pediatrician  i’ve got a great pediatrician  she knows her stuff  gets down on my son’s level  and lets me ask as many questions as i want without rolling her eyes   for the most part  i follow her advice  i’m fairly new to this parenting job and my 21-month old son didn’t come with a manual  kids really should come with manuals  right  with a troubleshooting section and 24-hour tech support   but sometimes i know my son better than his pediatrician and i know what’s going to work in my house and what is going to be met with frustration and tears from both of us   1  ditching the nightly bottle  my son’s pediatrician has been trying for months to get me to ditch the bottle  we acquiesced on the morning bottle around 15 months and it worked out just fine  but my son still needs the bottle at night  both psychologically and nutritionally  he doesn’t drink as much as i’d like during the day and he refuses to drink milk except in his bottle  not only is the bottle before bed a soothing way for us to relax and bond  he’s getting liquids and nutrients he may have missed   plus  most pediatricians won’t give a nursing mother flak about breastfeeding so leave me and my bottle alone   2  brushing teeth twice a day  i know  i know — i have to be better about this one  my son gets his teeth brushed diligently every night  but to anyone who pushes me to brush his teeth more than that  i challenge you to come over in the morning and get those baby pearly whites shiny while avoiding flying fists  feet  and anything he can find to throw  all while having your ear drums rupture from the shrieking   baby teeth fall out anyway   3  letting my kid and the dog share a spoon  the dog is a permanent fixture under my son’s chair during meal time  which means he catches anything that gets launched from his tray — pieces of quesadilla  a handful of mushed strawberries  a sticky cheerio  and utensils  my son is learning to feed himself with a fork and spoon  and it’s a work in progress   which means that when that spoon hits the floor  the 13-year-old dog forgets his arthritis and has that spoon in his mouth faster than you can yell “nothat’sgrossdon’tpickthatupstooooppppp ” by that time  i’m already exhausted and way too tired to get up and get a clean spoon  and it’s just going to fall back to the floor in 15 seconds anyway  so back to the toddler it goes   now to be fair  my pediatrician hasn’t actually told me not to let him share a spoon with the dog  but i figure it’s one of those things she would frown on   4  not following advice on diaper rash  several days in to what would become a monthlong scourge of fevers  rashes  and bronchitis  with a side of explosive diarrhea  my son’s pediatrician recommended a concoction of creams and medications to heal his ugly-looking diaper rash  it involved two types of diaper rash cream  yeast infection cream and maalox   i tried  i really did  but when you get all that cream on there and then have to dab maalox on with a cotton ball  it turns into this runny  paste-like substance  and with a squirmy toddler who is pretty darn interested in his nether regions  that concoction winds up everywhere except the diaper area  in the end  i ditched the maalox and his skin eventually healed up perfectly   5  calling in the specialists  i am your classic type a  defcon 5  high-strung new yorker … living in the deep south  my son was born 11 weeks prematurely  leaving him with a bunch of question marks as to whether or not he’d have physical or developmental delays  i am beyond grateful that we seem to have dodged all the major bullets and that my son is expected to completely catch up  but if i see something that might be not quite right  i get it checked out immediately   i was the one who requested a neurological work-up when his legs seemed unusually stiff  i was the one who requested a speech therapist when my son’s communication skills seemed to be further behind than normal  my pediatrician didn’t advise against the specialists  but she does take more of a wait-and-see approach and has kindly advised me to take my worry level down a few notches  the latter is probably good advice   6  picking a preschool  my son will be attending a preschool program for 2-year-olds in the fall  coming from new york city  where picking a preschool is like entering your child in the toddler version of the hunger games  i was all ready to have a plethora of choices   until i realized that there was not a plethora of choices in my new town  my pediatrician recommended a school that had a very loose 2-year-old program  meaning the kids would have circle time and story time  but really it was more of a daycare for moms who needed to drop their kids off for a couple of hours while they ran errands  when i took my son to visit  all the kids were sitting on the rug watching tv  ummm … no   i ended up picking a montessori school  my son and i loved it  and i think it’s going to be a great choice for him   the moral of the story  my communications degree is no match for my pediatrician’s medical degree  nine times out of ten — okay  more like 9 9 times out of 10 — she’s right  but sometimes you have to pull the mommy card and hope for the best 9 struggles of living with summer seasonal affective disorder  summer is not my season  there are people who don’t particularly care for heat and a dip in the pool  but then there are people like me  i have panic attacks over rising temperatures and the blazing sun   you may have heard of the “winter blues ” but seasonal affective disorder  sad  is something that can happen during any season  in my case  i’ve got the “summer blues ” and it’s not fun   the cleveland clinic estimates 4  to 6  of the u s  population suffers from sad  while most of these people experience a form of winter depression  10  will go through the blahs in the summer   dr  norman rosenthal who wrote about winter blues in his aptly named book  winter blues  was also part of the team who identified the existence of summer sad  light box therapy is one of the suggested treatments for people dealing with winter sad  but light is one of the things that bothers me most during the summer  when discussing comments from summer sad patients  rosenthal shares  “some of these people say things like  ‘the light cuts through me like a knife ’”  as a mom  knowing that summer is a rough season for me  i often feel defeated at the outset of long  hot days  i know other families are planning outings and pool parties and hanging-out-in-the-backyard type things  when i think about any of that  i freeze up — and not in the good way  instead of taking my kid to the playground or a picnic to celebrate his last day of school  i’ll be taking him to the movies  because it will be air conditioned  and dark  and did i mention air conditioned  we’ll probably spend a lot of our family time this summer inside  some days i may even need to close the blinds because it will just be too much sun   i know there are other parents who have the same kind of summer panic that i have  but it’s not exactly the easiest thing to talk about  on the surface it sounds like a joke  everyone loves the summer  right   people look forward to it all year  everyone hates the cold and the winter months … right  i know several friends who suffer from mild depression during the winter months because they miss the heat and the light and the sun  have you ever asked any of your friends if they are ok with the weather during the summer  you might have some friends like me   please don’t take it personally if we can’t come to your bbqs    my son w  luckily  doesn’t seem to have any problems with any of the seasons  i am incredibly thankful for this  if he could  he would stay outside all day  every day  knowing this and knowing that i am ill-equipped to be outside with him very often during the summer months  i made sure to enroll him in a summer camp packed with outdoor activities  just because i need to stay inside in a dark  cool room doesn’t mean he needs to   while my summer sad is sometimes debilitating for no reason other than the date of the year  there are some triggers that make things even more difficult  here are nine struggles of people living with summer seasonal affective disorder   1  the heat  it’s hot  too hot  make it stop being hot  seriously  it’s very  very hot   2  the brightness  could someone please turn off the sun   3  getting dressed  people wear less clothes in the summer months  if you have a not-so-great relationship with your butt and thighs  this could be a … problem  oh  and now it’s time to put on a swimsuit  great   4  the change in schedule  school’s out for summer  yay  oh  wait  you mean my kid is going to have different things going on every day  and i have to keep track  a change in routine and schedule is always something that is frustrating   5  socializing  i’m sorry  i can’t talk to you because the sun is shining and it’s hot and i can’t focus on anything except the beads of sweat sliding down my back   6  vacation guilt  let’s go somewhere  oh … wait  plane tickets for three is a bit out of our budget this year  let’s pile into the car and go somewhere  oh … wait  how much is that hotel  did i mention it’s hot  should we just stay home  we could make a fort  order pizza   vacationguilt  7  cooking  sorry  the oven and stove will not be in use until november   8  household chores  i just lost 5 lbs in water weight changing all the sheets in the house  cleaning the house in this heat is just too much work  nobody make a mess  see if you can pick up those crumbs  because i can not run the vacuum right now   9  working out  going to the gym in the summer … ha ha ha ha ha   when i feel myself getting overheated or in a panic  i take steps to cool down  one of my summer tricks is running cold water over my wrists to bring my body temperature down  or turning off all the lights  too much light can overwhelm me and simply closing my eyes doesn’t always fix it  when this happens  i have to find a dark room and get still  being aware of my limitations is helpful so i don’t overextend   i still feel like i am missing out on fun things  but i know i will catch up with the fun when the temperature drops the struggle of picky eaters in one perfect parody video  let’s be honest  we all have that one kid in our house that simply won’t eat anything we’re cooking  they’ll push away anything green  and if it doesn’t look a certain way  they’ll scream their head off  they want mac and cheese pronto and if we don’t give in  they’re not going to eat   the struggle is very real   at least we can take comfort in knowing that we’re not in this alone  as proven by the funny women of laughing moms  they hit the nail on the head with their picky eater parody of the song “rude ”  with lyrics like “why can’t you just eat your food  been cooking all day for you ” and “you say you hate it in a loud voice until you get your way ” we’re nodding our heads in approval   take a break from trying to get your tykes to eat their kale and watch this hilarious video  you won’t be disappointed the work of marriage is the hardest work there is  the day ends as it began  in a cold silence  a lingering sigh breaking the air   i contemplate reaching out  his warm body tense in the dark  but my mind flits over the million and a half slights of the day — dirty laundry left on the floor  words muttered under our breaths  resentment simmering — and my heart hardens   carefully  i turn on my side  the space between us widening   every day i tell myself that it’s silly  there’s nothing wrong  there are real problems in the world  i chide  get it together   but the day limps on haphazardly  like an old engine sputtering and starting  filling the air with a dark smoke   i try to put my finger on it  to put into the words the lingering tension under the surface but i can’t   is something wrong  i venture  blank stares  head shakes  i’m fine  i don’t know why you keep asking me  that’s the only thing that’s wrong   but something is wrong  even if i can’t pinpoint it  i marvel at the ability of what is unspoken and unseen to be so tangible  so palatable i feel like i can poke the air and find it  a gelatinous mass that quivers in my touch  unyielding and stubborn   i know everyone says that marriage takes work  but what exactly does that mean  does it mean that i  as the wife  need to add “keep marriage chugging along” to my to-do list  am i my marriage’s caretaker  what if i’m too tired to do the work  then what   probably a date night is what we need  says every article known to man  but my man is not a planner and if i’m the one doing the “work” of a date night is that really helping   i ponder what exactly the “work” of marriage is  wishing for a simple x   y   marital bliss   i wish i could approach marriage like i do my quest to get my body “back” after four kids — exercise every day  lean protein  guzzle that water  and i think of the solace i find in my work  tasks line up before me  waiting to be tackled  satisfaction emerging when they are done   but marriage   marriage is not so clear-cut  there is no formula to follow  no way to unearth the exact cause of slights and hurts and disappointments that spiral and snowball until you’re left shivering in the cold  unsure of how you got there without a coat   i suspect that i am one of those slightly annoying highly-sensitive people and i feel the nuances in our relationship at a deep level  and yet  i am the most stubborn person in the world  while confrontation is my husband’s arch nemesis  so there the issues remain  brick by brick growing until a laugh or a cry crumbles their flimsy foundation   i guess you could say i’ve been in the marriage game long enough to have faith to believe in life and love over the peaks  even when i’m trudging through the valleys   but getting through those valleys   i’m starting to realize that those hikes are the “work” that everyone was talking about what happens when wives go on strike  lately  i’ve been feeling just a tad unappreciated   like the kids not even thinking to bring their dishes to the sink after dinner   or my husband chiding them to “help mama keep the house clean” which is nice — but also sends the message that a clean home is a mother’s responsibility   i struggle a lot with a spouse vs  spouse mentality  it’s like the feminist influences so many of us were raised on haven’t exactly caught up to the practicalities of living as a wife who blends work and home and babies in a never-ending juggling fest   which is why  once in a great while  i fantasize about going on a wifely strike  they probably don’t even realize half of the stuff i do that keep this family chugging along   but then reality hits and i’m left to choose my rebellion in smaller ways  like this morning  when i simply stepped over my husband’s underwear on the bathroom floor  i cleaned up the bathroom sink  cleared the counter  and changed the trash  but would i pick those undies up  oh hell no   that’s probably as far as my “wife strike” will go  admittedly  but it came as a huge surprise to me to discover that some powerful things can happen when wives at home  just like me  really do go on strike   in 1975  25 000 icelandic women — 90  of all the women in the country — went on strike  they left their children  they left the cleaning  they left the lunch-making  they left the paid work they did  and simply walked out of the door   to protest the gender wage gap  the women left a string of messy kitchens and bewildered husbands to gather in rally to demand better pay and policies for women  and the result   “iceland’s men were barely coping  most employers did not make a fuss of the women disappearing but rather tried to prepare for the influx of overexcited youngsters who would have to accompany their fathers to work  some went out to buy sweets and gathered pencils and papers in a bid to keep the children occupied  sausages  the favorite ready meal of the time  sold out in supermarkets and many husbands ended up bribing older children to look after their younger siblings  schools  shops  nurseries  fish factories and other institutions had to shut down or run at half-capacity   the women responsible for setting morgunbladid  one of iceland’s main newspapers  returned cinderella-like to work at midnight  the paper was half its normal size the next day and contained only articles about the strike  the bank tellers who saw their positions filled by male superiors took special pleasure in going to the bank and keeping them busy  it was a moment of truth for many fathers who were exhausted at the end of the day  not surprisingly this day was later referred to by them as ‘the long friday  ” the guardian reported   i was blown away when i read that a housewife strike actually went down — shouldn’t we have learned this little tidbit in history class or something  that women matter  that the world actually can stop when a housewife revolts  that the toilet-scrubbing and the diaper-changing and the grocery shopping are actually important tasks with real value too   the women in iceland rocked that day — and they got results  today  iceland  is lauded as the “most feminist place in the world ” with impressive stats with the lowest gender gap of any country  high female college enrollment  and three-month parental leave for both mothers and fathers   i can only imagine what would happen if women in america took after our sisters in iceland  what could we change if we all took the day off  wiped our hands of all of the responsibilities that make managing marriage  life  so difficult  could we change the policies that — daily — threaten to crumble the joys of being a wife and mother  because it’s not the cleaning or the lunch-making or even the kids who are the problem  but the disparity between those tasks and the “real” work america seems to value   i don’t know  but i do know one thing for certain —  my husband’s underwear are staying on that floor until he picks them up zoe saldana s husband took her last name  and i hope it starts a trend  i never liked my last name while growing up  so it was super-excellent when i fell in love with a guy who happened to have a cool last name  i’d always assumed i’d take my husband’s last name anyway  it’s just how it’s always been done  right   when i think about it  it seems pretty sexist to continue a tradition rooted in man’s ownership of woman  and yet  as the guardian notes  roughly 90  of women still change their names when they get married  not only that  but ten percent of the american public still thinks that keeping your name means you aren’t dedicated to your marriage  and  get this  half of all americans think you should be legally required to take your husband’s name   whaaa   why isn’t it something each couple discusses before marriage  are we having children  who will stay at home with them when we do  are we keeping our names or do we like yours or mine better   most recently  actress zoe saldana is making headlines because italian artist marco perego took her name   “i tried to talk him out of it  i told him  ‘if you use my name  you’re going to be emasculated by your community of artists  by your latin community of men  by the world  ” the star told instyle  “but marco looks up at me and says  she puts on a cute italian accent   ‘ah  zoe  i don’t give a sheet ’”  saldana wrote a post to her facebook fans responding to the publicity surrounding her husband’s name change   fathers  sons  brothers  men everywhere  your legacy will not perish if you take your partner’s surname  or she keeps hers  i’ve been made aware that a comment i made regarding my marriage has garnered some attention  i felt proud that my husband decided to take my last name as his own… and i his  i shared my hesitation with him when he told me about his decision  not only did he say  “i don’t give a shhheeeetttt  ”  with a very strong italian accent    he also asked me  “why not  what are you so afraid of ” and it made me wonder… what am i so afraid of   why is it so surprising  shocking — eventful that a man would take his wife’s surname  women have never been asked if its ok for them to give up their names — why doesn’t that make the news   men  you will not cease to exist by taking your partner’s surname  on the contrary — you’ll be remembered as a man who stood by change  i know our sons will respect and admire their father more because their father lead by example   gentlemen  i implore you to think outside the box — remove the box altogether  let’s redefine masculinity  a real “man” leads along side his partner  a real man accepts his mortality  a real man acknowledges that nothing can be done alone   i hope that the “buzz” behind this topic isn’t just for gossip — but an inspiration for us all to look within and see what is truly important   let’s start by letting go of some of the limitations we have inherited from the past  and forge a new path moving forward   right on  zoe  i hope more strong  secure men choose to follow marco’s bold lead   as one commenter on huffington post noted  “a couple should take the name that would best further the family’s position  regardless of male or female ” good point  saldana is an actress  her name is a commodity so while it is a modern male move  it also makes perfect sense to take on that name   and in their case it isn’t just about taking a wife’s name  when you have kids — the couple has twin boys — you’re identifying as a family unit  he’s taking the family name   it’s a move similar move to my choice to keep my married name even though i’m now divorced so that i have the same name as my children  something far more important to me than my maiden name  point is  it’s a personal decision  others may disagree and feel that carrying on their name is the most important thing to consider because  it’s your lineage  your ancestry  your history  your story  but you are the architect of your story and your name is up to you   what do you think  would you want your husband to take your last name  would you take your wife’s last name  why or why not i let my husband dress me for a week — here s what happened  if you let your husband dress you for a week  what do you think he would pick out  a string bikini  a little black dress  jeans and a t-shirt   in honor of father’s day  and just out of curiosity  i handed over the stylist hat to my hubby and was pleasantly surprised at what hat he put on me  it wasn’t what i expected  and it helped me understand what he likes  and even more importantly  what he thinks of me   day 1   unlike my toddler  the first thing kerry was concerned about was picking an outfit that worked with what i was planning on doing that day   for errands  he wanted something casual  so he started with these green pants  he explained that he picked them not only because they’re his favorite color  but also because they’re wide-legged  he had heard those are coming back in style   he also picked out this bob dylan shirt because he likes me in it  for shoes  he chose flats so that i would be able to run errands and chase after the kids if i needed to   with the first day under my belt  i was feeling great  i was surprised at how thoughtful he was and how he really did want to pick out something that i would like   day 2   the next day i had an important lunch meeting with a client and had to look presentable  i was a little worried that he might put me in something that i wouldn’t feel stylish or confident in  i didn’t want to have to change in the car  like a teenage girl that didn’t want her parents to see what she was really wearing to high school   luckily  he chose this simple black dress with a tie around the waist and simple black shoes   “no jewelry  it’s not that fancy of an event ”  in fact  the dress and shoes were a little more dressy than i would’ve probably gone  but it was better than wearing sweat pants  like audrey hepburn  i believe in overdressing  and the meeting was a success   day 3   because of our schedules  we weren’t able to do seven consecutive days  but the next day that we were able to connect was when we were taking a trip to santa barbara  california   “i think i’ll go with the stripes  they remind me of the beach  and it’s comfortable ”  he also picked my favorite madewell jeans and wasn’t afraid to mix patterns with the animal print slip-ons   “i’ve seen you do this combo ” he said with a proud smile   it made me happy to see that he does sometimes pay attention to what i wear  the outfit was a great choice  i felt comfortable and was able to run around town unencumbered   day 4   the next day we were off on a bike ride  kerry made the bold move of choosing shorts  which i hadn’t worn yet this season  but between the shorts and tennies  it was really insightful   the sweater  although it had sporty features  was not usually a “work out” type shirt  but i could see why he picked it — it’s his favorite color and it went well with the outfit   day 5   the next time we were able to connect  i was shooting a webisode that day  this is where it could get tricky  i needed something that would look good for filming and something that i hadn’t worn for other things   i had to veto a few dresses that i had already worn on camera  but when he paired this striped shirt with the hot pink skirt  i knew it was a winner  i hadn’t worn this combo before  but i felt great in it and was really impressed with my budding stylist    don’t mind the curlers  this is the only picture i have from that day    day 6   for date night  i didn’t have any guidelines  we were grabbing dinner and a movie  so anything would really work  he picked this t-shirt by a local arizona company  mint tee apparel  and paired it with simple skinny black jeans   i suggested a cardigan since we were going to the movies  and he chose a black one   “i could see you wearing your black hat with this ”  he was right  i had almost been inseparable from this black hat the last few weeks  and i would’ve definitely topped off my outfit with it  i wasn’t sure if he liked when i wore hats  but either way  he knew i liked to wear it  so he suggested it   another spot-on outfit   day 7   the last day was a sunday  and he went right for this striped lula roe dress   “i like dresses because you only have one choice to make ”  that’s why i wear so many too  they’re super easy  i had always worn this dress with a simple gold long necklace  but he choose a statement necklace from 31bits   “i thought it could use a little color ” he said  like he had put a lot of thought into it   “do you want to wear flats or heels with this ”  “i’m fine with a pair of heels ” i responded   he passed over my platform black heels and the heels i had already worn earlier that week  and chose these lace-inspired heels from shoedazzle   “these look like fun ”  he’s right — they are fun  we were almost ready to go   “what tie should i wear ”  every sunday he asks  and every sunday i pick it out  i’m not sure why i thought this week would be any different  i chose a classic black tie   the experiment was over  and i started to contemplate how kerry was in the process  his weakness  maybe picking a few things that were dressier than they needed to be   but sometimes his unexpected pairings really worked  there were a few outfits that i would 100  wear again  it wasn’t surprising that most of the things he was drawn to were simple  a little black dress  jeans and a t-shirt  stripes  green colors   what did surprise me was how interested he was at finding something that he thought i would like  he didn’t have an evil laugh as he went through my wardrobe  there was no power trip or holding it over me  he genuinely wanted to show me how he does pay attention and how he really cares about me   if you’re brave  why don’t you try it  let your hubby pick out your outfit for father’s day or your next date night  what’s the worst thing that could happen  string bikini to dinner  wedding dress grocery shopping  most likely you’ll be pleasantly surprised   share your outfit on instagram with  husbandstylist the life-changing magic of tidying up vs  a real family  what needs decluttering  the workspace surrounding me as i type this  if you are anything like me  you probably want to read this mystical book — the life-changing magic of tidying up by marie kondo  it purports to change readers’ lives by teaching a sacred love-it-or-leave-it relationship with possessions that purifies both home and spirit  wow … sounds great  but how does it hold up against a home full of kids   reading it with my maternal scrutiny dialed up to 10  i have to admit  i liked this book from the very beginning  marie discusses the testimonials from people who have attended her tidying courses  and one of them was  “your course taught me to see what i really need and what i don’t  so i got a divorce  now i feel much happier ” bam  marie  you don’t pull any punches  tidying up sounds like a cheaper version of what i do — therapy  marie truly believes that tidying will help people organize their entire lives  and i am willing to believe her  at least for this moment   the main point of this book is that you can’t just tidy up one small area at a time  because that’s not going to keep you motivated  you need to do a 180 and tidy up your entire home in one fell swoop  the book commands you to change your entire mindset about cleaning   as convincing as marie is  some parts of this book are going to work for people with small kids and some won’t  here are some good points of hers for parents without the time to do a whole house tidying session   1  tidy by category  not by room   pull all your shoes out of your closet  and those by the door  and the ones in your gym bag or whatever  then — and this step is key — if the item doesn’t “spark joy” in you  you should discard it  you will know if your items spark joy by touching them  this is doable for child-related items  like baby clothes  you know you have a hoard of those and your husband got snipped last year  if you go through the whole bin and only save the items that bring you joy when you touch them  you will likely be able to give a whole bag to goodwill and only save the “best big sister” t-shirt and the baby bow tie   2  never ball your socks  because this is “disrespectful” to them   instead  lovingly fold them  little kids don’t know how to ball socks anyway  so give them the folding the socks job and set them up for succeed  and the whole “be nice to your socks” thing is cute  i guess   3  make closets look appealing   organize your clothes following gradations from dark colors to light  this is something to do and take a picture of for instagram  and may also actually help you find your kid’s blue dress for picture day   4  treat clothes with respect   wish them well when you discard them  and thank them for serving you  you can definitely do this with your kids  so that they learn to appreciate their possessions  if you’re donating them  you can say  “i hope another little girl likes wearing you one day ”  however  here are some recommendations that would probably not work for parents of small kids   1  discard clothes first   according to the book  the best sequence for evaluating and discarding is  clothes  then books  papers  miscellany  and lastly  sentimental mementoes  which she says can be very hard for the tidying novice  i speak for many moms of young kids when i say  don’t get rid of any of your clothes before you figure out what size you’re actually going to be once your kids actually go to school full time  from what i see at pickup  many moms really do get their bodies back once they are sleeping through the night and have time to eat an actual meal instead of leftover goldfish   2  tidy by osmosis   marie says that if you tidy up your own stuff  eventually your family will come around and start tidying their own stuff too  i sincerely doubt this will transpire in a chaotic home with multiple small children  i have been throwing out my own stuff for years and my husband has never decided on his own to tidy his closet  full disclosure  he does only have half of the closet and one less dresser than i have   if you want your husband to throw stuff out  my professional opinion is to either coerce him into it using your feminine wiles or buy a storage shed   3  mornings breed productivity   marie advises people to tidy in the morning when you’re fresh  this is a good attitude but ain’t gonna cut it for moms of kids who rise and shine at 5 am  if you have any shot at tidying  do it during nap time when you may not be fresh but you also don’t have human barnacles on your limbs   4  utilize the power of imagination   it is recommended that you have a vision of the ideal place where you want to live  in order to succeed at tidying  if your vision includes white couches and no diaper genies  this mental exercise will only depress you  maybe you could replace it with a vision of a place in which you could host a playdate without getting angry if someone colored on your furniture  because it isn’t that great anyway   my mom rating  four out of five stars  while this book may be kind of intense  and many moms may not be able to tidy to marie’s exacting standards  it does accomplish its goal  it makes you want to tidy   it also makes you use the word “tidy” like it’s a normal everyday verb   so i’m going to go fold my socks  but you won’t catch me getting rid of my three sizes of jeans until i am 100  sure that this is my real post-kids body  so around 2025 four words i stopped saying to live a happier life  “i don’t have time ” i exclaimed to my husband for what felt like the 100th thousandth time within the first year of having my son   ok  honestly  i might have hit that number within the first few months or even weeks   seriously  if i had a dollar for every time i let out that pathetic whine  i’d be a rich  rich woman   but it turns out i’m rich in another way  i finally learned what that phrase really means to me   it doesn’t mean there aren’t enough hours or minutes in the day  though it can often truly feel that way   but that whatever it is i’m making such claims over simply isn’t a priority for me right there in that moment   saying i don’t have time to work out means it’s not a priority for me right now — it’s not something i’m choosing to do at this moment  it doesn’t mean i don’t have the ability to find a spare 30 or even 10 minutes  it means i’m not willing to make it happen — and that’s ok   saying i don’t have time to get my work done doesn’t mean i literally don’t have time  it means i’m too tired or too brain dead or i’d simply rather be doing something else with those hours   saying i don’t have time to clean the house means i don’t want it to be a priority over playing with my son  if he doesn’t want to “play” doing laundry  i’m not willing to do it right then   often times “i don’t have time” can become our go-to excuse  it can certainly feel true at times  but the reality is  if we shift our frame of minds to “that’s not a priority for me right now ” we can not only accomplish so much more  we can also feel good about ourselves and how we spend our days   the key for me mentally is adding the “right now” part to it  i feel like a fraud and like i’m lying to myself if i say something like “fitness isn’t a priority” because it’s simply not true  the real truth is that it just isn’t a priority right now at that very moment  not that i’ve given up on it or that it’s not a part of my life anymore   things come and go in phases and there’s no more truth to be found in that than when it comes to parenting   some days i feel like i’ve truly used up all my hours and my energy  other days i see i can squeeze in a little bit more  but only if i see it as a priority  accepting that priorities can change on a daily or monthly basis allows me to feel better about how i’m allocating my time in any given moment   to tell myself that whatever i think needs to be done isn’t as important as something else  makes me feel confident in the choices i make  the best part is that only i can decide what takes priority  some days that’s a workout  some days that’s meeting a deadline  and some days it’s simply soaking up the fleeting hours i have with my son before he grows up to be an unruly teenager that wants nothing to do with his mom to my husband i will never fold your underwear  when we were dating  i would often spend time at my future husband’s house  where his mom would fold piles of laundry on their old wooden farm table   she would keep up a stream of chatter as she disappeared behind towers of t-shirts and jeans and i would respond awkwardly  talking to my future father in-law’s long johns   later  i would recount the conversation to my husband  “i can’t believe your mom folds your dad’s underwear ” i would exclaim  shaking my head  “i mean  it’s underwear  why would you fold it ”  in my mind  a wife folding her husband’s underwear represented the ultimate in female oppression  could there be any bigger waste of life than folding some garments meant to adorn the genitals   “sorry  but i will never  ever fold your underwear ” i told my boyfriend   fast forward 12 years later and can you guess what i was doing this very morning   yup  that’s right  i was folding my own stacks and stacks of laundry  although instead of at the kitchen table  i fold clothes on our bed   including a special pile devoted solely to my husband’s underwear   i have been folding my husband’s underwear for seven years now and like everything that i thought about marriage before i was actually married  it turns out i had no clue what i was talking about   where i once thought that marriage meant digging in my heels and drawing a firm line in the sand between “his” and “hers ” i now know that in relationships  the lines are blurry   while i once thought that the domestic chores that keep life chugging along would never be recognized by any man  i now feel the appreciation of a husband who takes the time to thank me for those very same clean and  haplessly  folded underwear   while i once thought that having a modern marriage meant waving my feminist flag and demanding chores be split 50 50  i now see that when you keep score  no one wins  my husband can clean the bathroom better than i can some days  even when i’m not exactly rushing to the mow the lawn   while i once thought that marriage was made of the “big” moments — the first dance to a song neither of us can now remember  the honeymoon we spent eating pb   j’s because we couldn’t afford anything else  the weekend getaways that never seem to happen — i now know that although the highlights are an important part of the journey  they aren’t the whole story   marriage  it seems  is built on the smaller moments  the moments when you stop keeping score  when you drag the garbage cans outside to the curb before the other one can  when you program the coffee maker so he wakes up the fresh smell of coffee brewing in the morning   marriage  it would appear  is when you lay down your stubborn side every now and then and realize that there is absolutely nothing wrong with doing something for your spouse without any fanfare  recognition  or reward   marriage  i have discovered  can be as simple as folding your husband’s underwear on a simple saturday morning as the rain falls softly outside your window and realizing that you are not oppressed  repressed  or possessed —  but maybe  just maybe  a little bit blessed don’t forget to look for the good  “when i was a boy and i would see scary things in the news  my mother would say to me  “look for the helpers  you will always find people who are helping ” — mr  rogers  my husband and i just finished watching the news  he sighed and crossed his arms  i took his cue to ask him what was bothering him   “this world  we brought our daughter into a messed up  scary world ”  “the world has always been scary ” i said  “but it’s always been pretty great too ”  then the phrase  witness to oklahoma beheading interviewed  tonight  ran across the scroll bar at the bottom of the screen  my husband gave me the side eye   “yeah  i mean  that’s bad  but human history is filled with beheadings  everything frightening in this world has been happening since the beginning of time  we’re fine ” then i stroked the back of his hair  like what i just said was super helpful and reassuring   i felt my own weird optimism shift  replaced with a sense that the veil wanted to be lifted from my eyes  but i couldn’t let it   the world is filled with gruesome truths that seem more like scary movies than real life  my joyful childhood and life of privilege have shielded me from many horrors  sure  i’ve had some “tough times ” i was chunky when i was a kid  i’ve been estranged from people i love  i’ve been dumped by a fiancé  i’ve had miscarriages  all of them worth the tears shed  yet seem so trivial to the frightening images we see looping on cable news   just this morning  a shooting at a charleston church right after a bible study  isis reigning terror in iraq  little girls kidnapped in nigeria by terrorists and despite all the  bringbackourgirls selfies  the girls still aren’t back and at least according to my news feed  we’re pretty much over it   israel  hamas  terrorism  and dead children  ferguson  baltimore  ebola  robin williams  suicide  depression  i know i’m neglecting at least 2 million other tragedies  but the point is – it’s bad   but i think it’s important to remember it’s been bad throughout human history  there’s nothing new under the sun  we just didn’t have a 24-hour news loop  pick a generation from the beginning of time and it’s easily riddled with atrocities  yet  every time  the human race has overcome  carried on and evolved   there’s an alternative to slipping into despair  i try to remember what mr  rogers’ mother said — look for the helpers   focus on the good   my  what turned out to be a horribly depressing  point is  when the world seems to be ending thanks to evil  it isn’t  how do i know  there are helpers  i see hope  love  compassion  there is far more good poured out each day  even though it never leads the news reports when something else bleeds   our lives and pursuit of happiness may seem trivial in the face of such fear  terror and adversity  but it isn’t so  just because tragedies are happening all around us doesn’t mean our lives  hopes  dreams  gifts and talents are pointless in the face of such horrors  nothing about our spirit and destined purpose are trivial   of course  it may mean we need to be more grateful  it may mean we need to be more compassionate  maybe more quiet  maybe more loud  or less self-absorbed  it may mean we need to get involved  take action  we may need to pray  or give money  or call a friend who lost a loved one on the phone instead of putting a heart emoticon on her facebook timeline   but it doesn’t mean we should quit  no  no  or throw up our hands and say “what’s the point of waking up and working hard towards becoming a graphic designer  what narcissistic psychopath would want a logo for their beauty products when people in the world are dying ” while emotionally eating the top off a gigantic muffin   sometimes the trivial can actually be monumental  a few years ago i wrote a story that went viral about accidentally farting in front of my  now  husband  out of everything i’ve written  i’m not so sure a story about farting is the one i would have picked to go viral  but whatever  beggars can’t be choosers   since writing it  i’ve received a lot of emails from people  but three changed my life  each one was from a different person with a different background  but a similar theme  they were going to commit suicide that night  had happened to read my story after it popped up on social media and they laughed so hard  they felt alive again  they felt hope  then they thanked me  and that was it   so what’s the point when the world is going to crap  that’s the point   i chatted back and forth with each of them for a spell  did my best to connect them with professionals who can help guide them for the rest of their journey  i’m not naive  i don’t think any deep-rooted problems were solved with a belly laugh  but for a moment  a silly  “trivial” story made a huge difference in someone’s life  that gives me such hope   helpers are all around us  we can’t forget to look for good   in colorado  there was an outpouring of support for a foster child who went on craigslist asking to rent a family for her birthday   in my hometown of omaha  a female officer was shot just hours before she was supposed to take maternity leave and the masses came forward to line our city’s streets to honor her   during the recent civil riots in cities like ferguson and baltimore  there were hundreds peacefully protesting  praying  providing water  comfort and counseling   and this is just what has been in my newsfeed this week   sometimes we can let the daily global  local or personal tragedies put us in such a malaise that we zip right by the old lady struggling to carry a bag of groceries up the stairs  and then we slam the door in her face   i can’t help but feel like our gifts are suited exactly for troubled times like these  if it’s to make someone laugh  tell a lighthearted joke  if it’s to write  share an uplifting poem  if it’s to sing  softly serenade a baby to sleep  if it’s math  help me figure out how much my local furniture store’s 25  off sale will get me on a new writing desk   i bet your heart will eventually nudge you to do something  in many cases it’s doing what you do best however trivial it may seem at the time   and you know what  sometimes we need to lay in bed and pull the blanket over our heads  if you need rest  please rest  but don’t lose hope  don’t lose sight of your purpose  don’t shrug off your gifts  talents or your dreams as trivial pursuits in light of a fallen world   take a pause  take a break  take a hiatus  take a nap  but set an alarm  we think  “what’s the point ” when we’re hopeless  our gifts were given to us so that we may give – hope   yes  i brought a child into an imperfect world that can be terrifying at times  it can also be so incredibly beautiful  complex and awe-inspiring  i wouldn’t want her to miss it for the world   so get up  look for the helpers  become one  look for the good  give your gifts  give hope   if we don’t do it  who will a letter to my ex-husband on father s day  you never really know what kind of parent someone will turn out to be   it’s one of the hardest jobs in the world — and not everybody is up to the task  i’ve known kind  intelligent men whose personalities seem tailor-made for parenting who can’t hack it on the front-lines of parenthood  and conversely  i’ve witnessed hardened bad boys transform into gelatinous piles of mush the moment their babies are born  tackling the dad role with gusto   who knew what kind of father the scrappy little rock’n’roller from philly i married 11 years ago would become  i didn’t   i don’t think he had any clue either  his own alcoholic dad ditched the family when he was nine  he had spent the 12 years prior to our first meeting and subsequent quickie marriage touring the world with his band  long days on the road  even longer nights in smoky clubs  not exactly the ingredients for exceptional parenting  hell  not even a recipe for adequate parenting   and yet   this man was born to be a father  it is his greatest joy  the thing he does best  the thing he loves most  better even than songwriting and guitar playing  his bond with our children is a revelation to me  it endlessly amazes me and i offer up silent thank you’s on a regular basis  because i know what it is to grow up without a dad  i know what it did to my heart and mind and how desperately i attempted to fill the holes my dad’s absence tore in my personality   i was  and still am  a scared  insecure girl without an anchor  one of the most curative forces has been witnessing my ex-husband with our three children  so i wanted to use this opportunity to tell the father of my children how thankful i am that he is their dad   dear serge   in the wake of our separation and eventual divorce last year you wrote this to me and i want to share it so the world knows what a caring  compassionate human being you are   “… it’s over now  we have three magic kids  as hard as it was for us all those years  it’s impossible for me to look back at any of it now and say it wasn’t worth it  because  in my book  it was worth it  we laughed some  we loved a special dog together  we loved a special needs dog together  and we had great sex at least  what  three or four times  right   haha  but mostly  we made three magic babies  and our individual lives are forever bettered by that alone  i know you know that  but i wanted to tell you i know it too … of course  our lives will continue to move apart in a million different ways  but because of these cool kids we got  there will always be a connection  just like you always told me since our separation  we won’t hang out all that much  we won’t probably know so many things about each others lives  and that is so surreal to me right now  but we will always have this unbreakable connection even if we piss all over it  i don’t want piss all over it  i can’t  it’s too sacred  i’m never gonna have that mom dad connection with another human as long as i live  we may move on to the point where we don’t even see each other or even think that much about one another someday  but still  the connection will remain  we will carry it with us until we both die ”  if the goal of parenting is to do better by your kids than was done by you then we have already won  serge  our own dads were virtually non-existent in our lives and yet  in spite of that fact — or maybe because of it — you have become the best dad imaginable  the dad who wakes up in the night to feed our baby  the dad who carries that curly-headed cherub around in a bjorn even though the chubby guy no longer fits into it because you can’t bear to let go of baby-wearing  the dad who spends hours upon hours making birthdays and christmases magical  the dad who panics at the slightest sniffle and drags his babies to the doctor in spite of his ex-wife’s declarations that it’s just a cold  relax for godsakes  the dad who cried fat tears as he sat next to me and proudly watched his daughter sing during her kindergarten concert last week  the dad who has taught our kids that magic exists and that their imaginations will take them the farthest in life   they are the creative  imaginative  compassionate  wise  beautiful beings they are because of you   while it didn’t work out for us in the marriage department  in the parenting department  we are winning  you are winning  i look forward to a future of co-parenting with the best partner i could ever ask for  thank you for making some of the hardest decisions of our lives with grace and style because it’s what was best for our babies  thank you for continuing to treat me with kindness and respect  even when you don’t feel like it  because i’m the mother of your children and you recognize that continuing to love me is another demonstration of your love for them and that guiding them through life together as a team is not only our toughest task but our biggest gift  thank you for loving violet  henry and charlie the way you do  i can’t fathom sharing them with anyone but you   happy father’s day   love   your ex-wife compatibility the real key to happily ever after  a friend recently told me something that dropped a bomb on my world   “my ex-husband and i had so much going for us … but the one thing that was missing was compatibility  we simply weren’t compatible  we had so much of the other stuff  but without the compatibility we couldn’t make it work ”  compatibility …  i knew the word  of course  everyone knows it and pretty much everybody who knows it knows what it means  too   from websters  “capable of existing together in harmony ”  whoa   it’s mighty impressive  you have to admit  this notion that you can be wholly in love with someone  connect with them in an infinite number of ways  hearts attached  sex spectacular  the two of you even laughing a lot at the others jokes all these years later  but still  all of that may never be enough   it occurred to me that this was exactly the problem i had had in my own failed marriage of ten years  and in all the other serious relationships i’d been involved in throughout my life  too   we weren’t compatible   i loved each one of them  there’s no doubt about that  i loved them so hard that there was no shortage of tears on my part whenever i’ve had to say goodbye   it was always a mystery to me  but looking back now and seeing my marriage  and my other love affairs  through the very simple and clear lens of compatibility  i feel like someone just rolled a damn boulder off my big toe  i was suffering from the uncertainty of what had happened to me  to us  but now it makes so much sense   hey  this might seem like absolutely obvious stuff  i get that   so think what you want   remember though  i overlooked it for a long time  and because of that i’m guessing a lot of other people might be overlooking it as well  listen  we can love another person with everything we’ve got  but without compatibility  without that simple magic that allows two people to breath easy whenever they’re together  love will always be an uphill climb   and what’s the point of that  you know i don t have many mom friends — and that s okay  when i was a senior in high school  my english teacher told me that after graduation  i’d be able to count my true friends on one hand  i rolled my eyes  just another old person spouting off outdated life lessons  i was in a tight circle of girlfriends and nothing could ever take away our bond   fast forward a few months  after my first week in college  someone asked how my high school best friend was doing  i was like  “who ”  friendships can be weird like that  in a way  it’s how it’s supposed to be   several months ago i wrote an essay for young girls about friendships  the point was simple  life is too short for crappy friends  it was easy to write because things don’t change much as we get older  sure  the intensity of mean girl cliques and the desire to be cool and popular can die down  but the principles are the same  we want to be liked  respected  and to share our lives with other people  we aren’t built to be alone  well  unless it’s an exhilarating target run without kids  obviously   although our culture has shifted  it appears our need for a tribe has stayed the same  but which individuals  which trusted few do we let into our lives   hopefully they will be the people who get our sense of humor and love us unconditionally  the people who call us out on our crap without judgment  the people who are loyal and would stand up for us against those hurting us  even if doing so could hurt them too  the people who don’t reject us the moment they realize we aren’t so perfect after all  is that too much to ask   well  it may be too much to ask of the woman we make friendly small talk with at the playground  she’d be like  “whoa  pump the brakes lady  i’ll share this bench  not my secrets ” but for the people who have been given the honor to truly know us  i don’t think it is   motherhood can be a particularly vulnerable  lonely time because we’re so damn needy  we need to relate  we need answers to our millions of questions  we need a laugh  probably a bath  and some friends that just “get it ” misery loves company  but joy does too   so  we join online pregnancy and mommy groups  we book play dates  join church groups  and introduce ourselves on the playground  this desire to fill the friendship void  however  can lead to the slightest hint of desperation  and our standards for friendship can get a little lax  i’ve witnessed mommy groups devolve into a mean girls message forum where barely anyone gets out alive  relationships are hard  and weird   to make things even more complicated  even when we do have wonderful friends  we can still feel isolated and lonely  this is common  friends growing distant with little explanation is also common  rejection  sadly  is common too  life is a constant cycle of life and death and friendship certainly isn’t immune to this ebb and flow   i’m fortunate enough to have a small handful of close friends i can rely on  but that doesn’t mean loneliness evades me  it can be hard to find something to talk about when the only thing happening in my life is my baby  infants have an all-encompassing way about them  i’m afraid  i’m also committed to stepping into my purpose as a writer  few understand why i would stay up until 3 am writing with an infant who is a dedicated morning person  so  whenever i meet someone new and there’s a connection  i tend to speed things up and get to the good parts of the friendship where you can say anything  be confidants and laugh hysterically  i offer over the best parts of myself like a fragile gift i just know they will cherish and keep close to their heart  except  of course  when they don’t   maybe i do it because i’m a libra  maybe i do it because i’m an optimist  maybe it’s because i’m prideful and trick myself into thinking no one can hurt me  probably all of the above  i think i need the bible verse  “don’t cast your pearls before swine” tattooed on my forearm as a reminder  or maybe written in pen or something washable   if people don’t offer what i want or need in a friendship  it doesn’t make them a bad person  it just means i shouldn’t have given them my pearls   as each year passes  my tolerance for people who don’t respect and value my pearls dwindles  i’m always shocked by how neediness can cause me to compromise my own self respect and dignity  i’ve allowed friends to be emotionally abusive and manipulative because i knew their personal issues and anxieties were making them behave that way  and told myself i was strong enough to not take it personally  i’ve walked away from a wonderful person who grew distant over a trivial conflict  it was a sure sign i gave my pearls to someone who didn’t really want them  i still miss her   i read once that in order to love yourself  sometimes you’ll appear unloving  i think that’s why i stuck around some friendships that were causing me to wither — i didn’t want to appear callus or be misunderstood among our mutual friends  yet  if i’m not growing or thriving  i’m dying  as i’ve said before  life’s too short for crappy friends   so  when we find ourselves feeling lonely  what are we to do   i don’t have the answer  but i have some ideas  a lonely  isolated season  like winter  is the ultimate reset button  a time for rest  reading  preparing  and more time to fall in love with ourselves  not from a place of ego  but from a place of self-worth  then  as the sun begins to shine again and the birds begin to sing  we enter a new season of friendships and growth  i’m starting to sound like a new age guru sitting next a man playing a wooden flute  but i may be on to something here   not all friends are created equal and they definitely aren’t all meant to last forever  sometimes they do  but usually it’s for a certain time  during a certain job  during a particular phase  or during a long flight   and we needed them all  good and bad  in some way or another  they come into our lives  guised as a friend — but perhaps they were an obstacle  a distraction  or a lesson we needed to learn  maybe they were a mirror that showed us something we needed to realize about ourselves  we always learn from the people who show up in our lives  we can’t help it   as for the friend that hurts us  rejects us  or walks away from us like we’re nothing — well  sometimes i’m that friend  perhaps sometimes we need an isolated season to grow into the friend we want for ourselves  then  as is the order of things  what we need shows up right on our doorstep   see  the hard truth is that most people won’t be loyal to us  most people will be awkward and distant during our tougher times  most people would put business  money  reputation  hell — even their nail appointments over us   but some won’t  and those precious friends who cherish our pearls  well  they will be few  i would even guess you could only count them on one hand   the perfect amount   i guess old english teachers know what they’re talking about after all 14 lessons from wives who think that marriage is easy  you probably know by now that when it comes to marriage  my point of view is that despite the almost immeasurable joy it brings  marriage is hard and also — marriage is hard   in general  i think that most married people would agree  except for these wives  they swear that marriage is easy — and that the rest of us just have it all wrong  here are 14 lessons they have to offer those of us who could probably stand to lean more toward the “easy” camp   1  backgrounds aren’t everything   melissa cohen  a 41-year-old mother of three children  12  9  and 5   has been married for 12 years and says that her “easy” marriage was a surprise   “my parents had divorced  and  it seemed as though everyone i knew growing up was either divorced or in unhappy marriages … when i imagined my future  i never pictured a husband ” but she describes meeting her husband as “magic” and says that everything changed in that moment  “it was romantic and sweet  passionate and totally all encompassing ”  2  hardships brings you closer  not apart   one of the keys of an “easy” marriage may be the couples who see the struggles as an opportunity to draw closer instead of driving a wedge between them   early on in their relationship  melissa suffered a miscarriage  an experience that she says showed her how empowering marriage could really be  “the loss  as devastating as it was  broke down all of my defenses in so many ways ” she says  “i felt safe with him  in a way that i had never anticipated and could not have predicted  through the whole experience  it was a twin pregnancy  and i lost them about a week apart   he was the only thing that made sense to me ”  3  your spouse is your best friend   “ my husband  was  and still is  my best friend  my partner ” says melissa  “we’ve been together for 13 and a half years  and he’s still the person that i most want to be with  the one i call first  and the person who’s always on my side ”  4  the relationship comes first   “ my husband  and i have the same goals ” melissa says  “and one of the most important goals is a strong  vibrant marriage  so we make it happen  even when we’re fighting  i always know that we’re on the same team … i’d see a marriage counselor in a heartbeat  and i know that my husband would as well  because our marriage is too important  it’s too vital to our family  to let it fail ”  4  big differences aren’t a deal-breaker   one of the things i most admire about melisa’s marriage is that she’s not just floating dreamily down easy marriage lane —  she’s actually navigating down some difficult marriage terrain  namely  the fact that she and her husband practiced different religions early on their relationship   “he is jewish  and i wasn’t ” melissa explains  “i ended up converting about six years ago  and we discussed it endlessly  working through our cultural differences  deciding on what we wanted and needed for our own identity and how we wanted to raise our children — that took  takes   a lot of patience  but at the end of the day  what i want is our family  together  and he feels the same way ”  5  compromise is key   “i want  my husband  to have a great relationship with all of his kids ” continues melissa  “and i do what i can to facilitate that  that means that we compromise  i never planned on letting my kids play with toy guns  or play video games  or watch zombie movies  but … he’s as much their parent as i am  i’m sure he never planned on co-sleeping or having kids who nursed into toddlerhood  but because i wanted that  that’s what we did ”  6  marriage is about respecting each other’s crazy   want to hear my official theory on marriage  we’re all crazy  when it comes right down to it  so the key is respecting what makes our partner crazy and also being honest about our own crazy quirks   cohen says the key is picking your battles — and if something really bothers you  to simply do it yourself  “we tend to do the ‘if you don’t like the way i do it  do yourself’ and ‘if you feel really strongly about this  i’ll do what i can do get on board’ mentality ” she explains  “and it works  for example  i hate dirty dishes  the only i hate more than doing the dishes is having them in the sink waiting  so i do them  and i do it fast ”  7  marriage means not taking the other for granted   where i’m more apt to pitch a fit about bearing the brunt of the at-home work in my marriage  melissa sees things a lot differently than i do   “i’m home with the kids more than he is  i just started working part-time after being home full time for the past ten years  ” she says  “ but  we both know we couldn’t do what we do without the other  without me at home  he’d never be able to focus at his job  and put in the hours required  without him working so hard to provide for our family  there is no way that i would have been able to stay home until all our kids were in school  we don’t take the other for granted ”  that certainly sounds a lot more productive than complaining about who has it harder  doesn’t it  note taken   8  having crap in common can help   while opposites attract and all of that  when it comes right down to it  having something — anything — in common obviously can be key in a marriage   “my husband and i are both very spiritually minded  both of us love to read  we both love politics and debating ” says melissa  “even when we disagree … we still have those in common  we value the same things ”  9  enjoying your spouse’s company is kind of a big deal   remember what it felt like to genuinely just want to be around each other  like the get-a-thrill-just-from-being-near in each other  these wives say they hold on to that feeling   “i really  legitimately  love spending time with  my husband  ” says melissa  “he’s brilliant  funny and endlessly kind and i’m so  so grateful to have him ”  10  there is no one-size-fits-all  really   while she’s happy to divulge her secrets to a happy and easy marriage  melissa cautions that there really is no one-size-fits-all recipe   “i’m not a huge fan of sweeping pronouncements ” she confesses  “what works for us might not work for everyone  but i do think that in order to have a happy marriage  you need to have honesty  absolute commitment  and really  really high standards ”  11  they are 100  honest   melanie  a 23-year-0ld mother of three  claims that although she and tim never actually fight  they “talk about everything ”  “if something he says hurts my feelings  i tell him ” melanie explains  “he doesn’t try to hurt me on purpose  so me telling him how i feel is the only way he realizes it even happened most of the time ”  12  they are deliberate about their relationship   “we didn’t go into  marriage  lightly ” explains 27-year-old katie  “we talked  planned  and made sure we were on the same page  we didn’t just come up with an idea of how we want our marriage to be  and then hope it turns out that way — we constantly are aware of what we want our marriage to be and we put forth the effort to keep it that way ”  13  they don’t keep score   “we don’t keep score ” edison explains  “i won’t be like  ‘oh hey  i did the laundry last time — it’s your turn now ’ we both  constantly  do the best we can by each other  marriage does not come with a scoreboard  it’s a team sport  if you try to “keep score” in marriage  you make it a competition  it’s not  you’re on the same side  play it as a team  not a contest ”  14  they feel a teensy bit bad for you   katie just doesn’t understand couples who want to dwell on the little things  “don’t pick fights about things that don’t matter ” she says  “if your spouse constantly leaves their socks in the ‘wrong’ place  don’t get angry about it  they are just socks  pick  em up and move on  not a big deal ”  in her eyes  marriage is definitely work  but it doesn’t have to be hard  “my honest thought when someone talks about how hard marriage is sadness ” confesses katie  “i’m sad for the people who feel like their marriage is so hard  because i honestly don’t think marriage has to be hard  and it makes me sad ”  it makes me sad too  katie  but not sad enough to pick up my husband’s socks   kidding   maybe  no  really  i’m kidding   i think 7-11 and wegmans bottled water recalled due to e  coli concerns  not even water is safe from food contamination  it seems   wegmans  an upstate new york supermarket with devoted shoppers — along with several other chains including giant food stores  shaws  and 7-11 — recalled its branded bottled water due to potential e  coli contamination   niagara bottling  a leading private-label water bottling company in the u s   has reported that e  coli bacteria was found in one of its water spring sources on june 10  2015  “these bacteria can make you sick  and are a particular concern for people with weakened immune systems ” the brand said in a statement   the bottling company said no reports of illness have been found  nor has anyone complained yet  but the voluntary recall is still in effect   “out of an abundance of caution and in the strict interest of public safety  niagara bottling  llc is issuing a voluntary recall for all spring water products produced at both the hamburg  pa and allentown  pa facilities from the time frame of 3am june 10th to 8pm june 18  2015 ” said niagara bottling in their statement   other brands affected besides wegmans include acadia  the store brand of giant food stores   acme  big y  best yet  7-11  niagara  nature’s place  pricerite  superchill  morning fresh  shaws  shoprite  and western beef blue  more information can be found in niagara bottling’s consumer notice   here’s how to confirm if your water has been affected   “to determine if your product is affected  please reference the following information on the code  which can be found on the bottle  the code will indicate the place  date and time that the product was produced  the only affected products have codes that begin with the letter f  for hamburg  or a  for allentown   the first digit after the letter indicates the number of the production line  the next two numbers indicate the day  then the month in letters  the year  and then the time  based on a 24-hour clock ”  example  a610jun15 2000  allentown line 6  manufactured on june 10  2015 at 8pm   this is not the first household food item to be recalled this year  blue bell creameries and jeni’s splendid ice cream both  sadly  had recalls this year due to listeria   like niagara bottling company  jeni’s ceo said they’d rather be safe than sorry with recalling all of the products in a statement  “we have decided to recall everything currently on retailer shelves  and we are closing our scoop shops until we are 100  confident every item we sell is safe ”  of course  no one could forget the sabra hummus recall due to another listeria possibility  we have to question the food in our supermarkets — is it more contaminated  or are we just more aware of contamination  if you guessed the latter  you’re correct   lisa moskovitz  rd  founder of new york nutrition group  explained the situation to yahoo health  saying “the fda has just become more and more diligent on detecting these types of contaminants  and then protecting consumers by spreading the news as fast as possible ”  the word also spreads a lot faster thanks to social platforms and immediate news  which keeps even more people safe what i gained when i gave up family dinners  as the early evening light streams through the dining room windows  my daughter folds cloth napkins and places silverware atop the triangles of calico  home from work early  my husband takes his seat at the head of the table  i untie my apron  and pour two glasses of crisp white wine and one glass of fresh  homemade almond milk for the little one  i dish servings of the healthy  from-scratch meal i’ve made onto my family’s plates  my daughter smiles with glee because i’ve made her favorite — asparagus gratin  we celebrate our togetherness  once again  for our sacred family dinner   ok  seriously  i’m about to gag just writing this  the scene above has never  ever happened in my house and i’d probably pass out from shock if it did   yet  back when i got married and we started our family  i imagined that we’d share nightly meals that looked like something straight out of a norman rockwell painting  after all  everything i’d read  and i’d read a lot  told me that family meals were essential to a kid’s future  big dinners not only developed a child’s palate  they also helped them bond  taught communication skills  prevented obesity and addiction  and even raised iqs  if i didn’t want my daughter to grow up to be an unhealthy failure  i’d better get a cookin’   i made my best effort  i swear  but to my disappointment  i quickly realized that family dinners weren’t going to happen for us  my husband had a long commute  sometimes two hours  and often he wouldn’t get home until 8 pm  on the nights he did make it home earlier  most of the time he wasn’t in the mood for a big dinner   while i’m more of a three-meals-a-day kind of person  my husband is a grazer who prefers smaller snacks throughout the day  on top of that  we have totally different taste buds  so my meat and potato dinners weren’t appealing to him  turns out  they weren’t appealing to our daughter either  when it comes to food  she’s a grazer much like her dad  plus she has her own food quirks  she’s a kid after all  so her eating habits are fickle  and sometimes the things she’ll eat are pretty limited   so  i found myself spending hours cooking elaborate meals that only i was eating  i was furious  and still dead-set on having my way  we were going to eat family dinners if it killed me  i had to stick to my convictions on this one  after all  i had a ton of research to back me up  i was right and could prove it   so i fought and i argued and i tried to boss my family around  i tried to bully them into sitting down and eating what i’d cooked because this was good for us  except that it wasn’t good for anyone  everyone was miserable  especially me  and i felt like a failure   the idyllic dinnertime that i longed for never came to pass  by trying to force my agenda  i managed to create tension  misery  and disappointment  and i knew there was no way that could be healthy  so i waved a white napkin over my head and surrendered   dinnertime looks much different these days  our evening meal could be nachos in the living room  a snack of fruit and nuts on a blanket in the backyard  or veggies and dip standing in the kitchen  sometimes my husband whips up a quick pan of fried rice or sometimes i’ll heat up a pot of soup  there are nights when we skip dinner altogether if no one is hungry  and i’m not opposed to occasionally pouring a couple bowls of granola splashed with almond milk  not homemade  and calling it a day  the point is — we eat what and when we feel like and our family time isn’t centered around eating   when i gave up my expectations about family dinners  everything got better  evenings were enjoyable and relaxed again  i had a lot less to clean up for one thing  so i was actually spending more quality time with my husband and daughter  which was the whole reason i pushed for the dinners in the first place  on top of that  our grocery bill went down because i wasn’t buying ingredients for elaborate dishes that went to waste  i even lost weight   more importantly  we were happy because the needs and idiosyncrasies of each family member were respected  no one was being forced to sit at the table when they’d rather be doing something else  no one had to eat food that they weren’t hungry for   in a flexible atmosphere where we could decompress from our busy days  conversation flowed naturally  sometimes over a snack in the kitchen  and sometimes during an evening walk around the neighborhood  we found we bonded better over a shared family bedtime ritual than we did over food  bath time  stories  and cuddling in bed replaced chopping  sautéing  and dish washing  we had communication and quality time in abundance   our daughter was still learning the same important skills  and even more  i continued providing healthy food choices and she was learning to be in control over her own hunger  what she ate and when  which will hopefully lead to positive attitudes about food later in life   it’s important to keep the studies about things like family dinners in perspective  when we become too rigid with our expectations we can actually create the opposite of the desired effect and cancel out any potential benefits  remember  not everything works for every family and that’s ok  giving up family dinners turned out to be the healthiest choice for us  and hey  i now wear a smaller pants size because of it 10 things parents of adhd kids wish you understood  when my son was in first grade  he came home after school very quiet and withdrawn  i noticed he was picking at his cuticles   “what’s wrong  buddy ” i asked   “i hate school ” he said   “what  why ” he loved to read  was great at math  and was super curious by nature   “every day  the teacher writes my name on the board ” he said  stomping his foot on the floor  “he adds a million check marks  the other kids think i’m bad  no one knows how hard i try ”  he was 6 years old at the time   kids with “invisible” special needs are often misunderstood  adhd kids may be brimming with energy  creativity  and ideas  but today’s expectations make childhood a real challenge  as a parent  i don’t want my child defined by his limitations  at the same time  it’s frustrating when people just “don’t get it ”  here are 10 things parents of adhd kids wish you understood   1  it’s in the wiring   adhd is a neurobiological disorder  not a personality flaw   kids with adhd  particularly the hyperactive-impulsive type  have a ton of energy  they may struggle to sit still and stay focused  they are not trying to be difficult  they are wired differently   2  they need encouragement   getting criticized all day is a self-esteem killer  kids with adhd get more than their share of negative attention  “pay attention  don’t kick the seat in front of you ” instead  look for and praise the positive  “i love your enthusiasm  you have a great imagination ”  it’s not just good for adhd kids  it’s good for all of us   3  they’re consistently inconsistent   “he followed along so well yesterday  she was an angel at grandma’s house last week ”  kids with adhd can be especially sensitive to mood  medication  the time of day  and what’s going on around them  don’t turn a “bad day” into a “bad kid ” try again another time — you may be surprised   4  everyone needs a friend   kids with adhd can have a tough time controlling their impulses  studies show that they emotionally mature later than others  this can be rough on friendships  before you cross that “active” kid off the birthday party invite list  consider asking his mom to stay at the party  even if it’s a drop-off   it’s much nicer than not inviting him at all   5  don’t take it personally   “omg  i can’t believe he said that ”  if an adhd kid isn’t paying attention  please don’t think he’s spacing out on you  if he’s being argumentative  don’t think he doesn’t respect you  it isn’t personal  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  by its very nature  means he has a hard time paying attention and controlling his impulses  it’s not a free pass to misbehave  remind him he’s a good guy and you expect him to act like it  these are expectations he can meet   6  depression can be a problem   adhd and depression commonly occur together  trying to live up to too-high expectations can make a kid feel like a failure — from a very young age  adhd issues at school and with friends can lead to depression  especially in the teen years  it takes a village to raise our kids  keep an eye out for signs and symptoms of depression  especially among teens   7  other issues are common   diagnosis  it’s complicated   depression isn’t the only issue that can occur with adhd  research shows that as many as 65  of kids with adhd will have one or more other conditions at some point in their lives  including anxiety  obsessive compulsive disorder  ocd   bipolar disorder  or oppositional defiant disorder  odd   if you know a kid — or a family — that needs support  offer it  something as simple as a kind word can go a long way   8  they don’t need another judge judy   impulsive kids figure out what went wrong after it happens  this makes them easy targets for labels  such as “bad kid ” “mean girl ” or “bully ” try not to judge  accept an apology  give a kid a second chance  or a third  know that they — and their parents — are working hard  see list numbers 1 – 7    9  our kids are listening   when i was a kid  there was a boy in the neighborhood who had tourette’s syndrome and would shout out bad words  when we complained  my mother would tell us to “get off our high horse” and go outside and play with him  she’d remind us that he can’t help it and who were we to think we were so perfect   while it’s true that my mom wanted to watch merv griffin  it was a great lesson  times have changed but our kids are still listening  the biggest influence on how they think about kids who are different is how we think about them   10  different is good   “tolerance  compromise  understanding  acceptance  patience — i want those all to be very sharp tools in my shed ” –cee lo green   whether a kid is brilliant  fiery  compassionate  or imaginative  different is good  kids with adhd serve as reminders that variety is the spice of life  with the slightest shift in perspective  “bossy” turns into bold  “weird” turns into unique  learning to appreciate and get along with a diverse range of personalities is a life skill from which all kids — and adults — can benefit   cue  adhd superstar adam levine 4 reasons why every mom needs nice lingerie  i never knew much about underwear when i was growing up  it was meant to be functional  comfortable  must be worn  not shown  when i first heard the word lingerie i thought  “wow  so exotic and fancy ”  lingerie  using a french word to describe your underoos put a whole different spin on things   i had an expensive lingerie habit as a young woman  i discovered matching bras and panties  and silky nightgowns not meant to be slept in   wink-wink-nudge   i loved the cute little lacy cheeky shorts and strappy camisoles  those colorful scraps of satin made me feel pretty  confident  sexy  and sometimes just plain naughty  i had something for all occasions   and then i became a mom   my pretty lingerie was gradually replaced with sports bras and cotton granny panties  some of my lingerie survived the “i’ll never wear that again” purges but that stuff got shoved further back in the dresser drawer as they competed with my everyday duds  occasionally  my hand would accidentally scoop up a thong while rummaging for briefs to wear under my yoga pants and i would sigh  because that thong reminded me of what i wasn’t anymore   i wasn’t sexy   there was still sex  different sex  on the fly sex  when we had time  when the stars aligned and the kids were glued to a movie   and then one day  i decided to treat myself  i’m don’t remember exactly what drew me to the store that starts with victoria and ends with secret  i don’t know what made me want to buy underwear that didn’t come in a six-count package but that’s exactly what i did   i bought a light blue bra with a matching panty  simple  comfortable  but it was pretty  feminine  wearing it made me feel good  confident  more like a woman  even when hidden underneath my mom clothes  soon after  i tossed most of my very large collection of shapeless britches and invested in some nice pieces of “everyday lingerie ” it’s surprising to me how something as small as upgrading my undies makes such a big difference  but it does   here are four reasons moms need nice lingerie   1  it’s accessible and affordable  if you have an extra  500 you can buy a really nice bra from la perla  but for me  that’s about as likely to happen as getting through the day without caffeine  my coffee cup and i are one  so i’m thinking  “no  crazy-expensive bra  you and i aren’t destined to meet up close and personal ” but all is not lost  you can get something very similar at target that will allow you to have something nice and still pay your bills   if a store sells clothes  they sell lingerie  you can find whimsical and subtly sexy alongside the basic beige that i’ve decided is just no fun  there’s a sea of pretty and fun things out there for you to discover and much of it is actually comfortable   here are a few of my favorites …  2  sexier sex  sexy underwear makes you feel sexy  when you feel sexy  you seek out more sex  it’s pretty simple  no  good sex isn’t always about the window dressing but taking some time to be deliberate about attracting your partner … well  why not  and  sexy doesn’t mean made of black mesh  what makes you feel sexy is what matters   3  it makes you feel good about yourself  i don’t know why i get a boost of confidence from a pretty bra worn under my hoodie  but i do  even on days where the most exciting thing i do is making my grocery list  lingerie just plain makes me feel good about myself   4  it reminds you that you’re more than just a mom … and moms deserve nice things  as moms  we let our needs and wants take a backseat to our families  or straight up ignore them   come on … how many times have you chowed down on what was left on your kid’s plate  standing in the kitchen  trying to multi-task doing 17 other things   i know i should take more time for myself but life is busy  wearing nice lingerie is one small  simple way i pamper myself  it’s a reminder that i’m a woman and not just a mom a dad and daughter attempt a pinterest dinner  i was scouring pinterest for recipes to make for my little family of three  and it dawned on me … i’ve really never cooked with the smallest member — my 2-year-old daughter ruth  sure  she’s been in the kitchen while i’ve cooked for her  but i’d never cooked with her   this is why … i’m kind of a fanatic when it comes to cooking  not that i have any intricate knowledge of the culinary arts  i just learned how to poach an egg last month   but rather  i feel an intense drive to not only make the food as excellent as possible  but to also have it all ready at the exact same moment  but a toddler does not a productive kitchen make   with father’s day coming up  i figured now was a great time to put my weird neuroses behind me  and try something new with my daughter  we would attempt to recreate two recipes  and the artfully styled pinterest photos that accompanied them  and yes  with a toddler co-chef   the main course was mozzarella  tomato  and basil pizza  as my wife and i started making pizza after our trip to italy  but haven’t sat down to make one with ruth  this would be a nice way to share it with her  and the dessert was chocolate semifreddo because we like making themed suppers   to commence our activity  we started with a few ingredients that are a must for toddlers  a step stool  good background music  for you  not her   aprons  forgot those this time  whoops   and a helper that can do dishes after   i found that while cooking with my daughter  you have to give in and let it go  you’re singing the frozen theme song  now  aren’t you    i knew this going in  that doesn’t mean i was successful  i constantly had to curb my mild reprimands and urge to do everything myself   first came the semifreddo  inspiration pictured below   and ruth was pumped to see all the chocolate as i chopped the bars into chunks  her toddler urges to spill  tamper  and whine were all subdued by the various samplings she took of the chocolate chunks  which was great  because i could give my full attention to the heating of the eggs and sugar   when it came time to fold the mixtures together  i had to again  let it go  and let ruth’s poor whisking form have at it  whipping the cream and chocolate together quite messily — but she loved it   when she whisked sugar  chocolate  and egg fluid all over the counters  i tried my darndest to embrace the mess and enjoy watching her try — she really loved whisking  messy or not  whereas i view it as a means to an end  maybe i should try and enjoy each part of the process  maybe then i won’t grow an ulcer by the time i’m 33   ultimately  for the semifreddo  having those chocolate chunks as a useful distraction for the more complicated culinary moves was crucial  we popped the stuff in the freezer and moved on to making the pizza   the dough was a huge success for ruth  she could mash it  roll it  pick off bits to sample  gross  but she loved it   plus  i could pretend like i was a real pizza mensch and flop the dough around like a pro  letting ruth place the toppings worked well too  as she made her very own pizza decorations and could feel ownership of our pie  “decorate” is a term very familiar to ruth and it helped offset her desire to just eat the raw pizza   once i popped them in the oven  i flipped the oven light on so ruth could peek at the “za” as it baked  around this time she started asking for salami  or peanut butter  or anything to eat for dinner  all this cooking made her hungry  this is a nice opportunity to teach your child about the virtue of patience … or you could just give her some apple slices like i did   now it was time to enjoy the food  partly relieved to be done trying to simultaneously cook and wrangle ruth  it was a nice respite to sit back and chow  of course  our pizza didn’t look quite as nice as the pizza from the pinterest post  due to a 2-year-old’s meddling  but overall  the recipe turned out as expected   the toddler loved it  ruth could use her hands without reprimand and eat her slice however she wanted  she likes to pick some tomato off  nibble on some cheese  take a bite of crust  she’s a roundabout pizza eater and enjoyed pointing out and naming all the ingredients we’d put onto the pizza   however your pizza turns out — in our case  it was delicious — you’ll always have the time you spent together in the kitchen  as we ate  i talked with ruth about all we did  remember the whisks  ruth  ruth  “i spilled the flour ” it was nice to see her take away the concept of waiting for the pizza to cook  she’d tell me  “we have to wait ” while the pizza baked in the oven as if i was the one begging for a snack in the meantime   then came dessert  we got the semifreddo looking pretty close to the pinterest photo  if i do say so myself  though it didn’t scoop easily into a cone  with some effort  it could be fitted nicely into a cone  a spoon straight to the frozen container also works just fine   the activity turned out to be the perfect father-daughter experience we needed  cooking with a toddler is messy and stilted  but it’s quality time to chat  teach  and even learn from the child — why not take another sample of melted chocolate  it’s experiences like these that remind me that i need to slow down  embrace the mess and chaos of toddler-dom  and enjoy this tiny creature in all facets of our life together did you know what kind of parent your partner would be  when your eyes met across a crowded room and you set your sights on the hot guy with the great eyebrows  you weren’t consciously thinking about what kind of bedtime routine he’d favor as a parent   in fact even when you walked down the aisle  you never really knew just how good  bad  or indifferent a parent your husband would be because you’d never experienced raising a kid together   and don’t try to tell me that owning a dog together is the same thing  it isn’t    likewise  he had no idea what kind of mom you were gonna make  because no matter how well you know a person  agreeing on parenting techniques is a whole different ballgame   recently  actress and mom of three jennifer garner said in an interview with yahoo parenting   “you just go on a ride together because you don’t know who you’re going to be when you first have a baby and you don’t know who  your partner  is going to be  you have to just hang in there while you figure it out — and have a lot of patience for each other ”  i couldn’t agree more  my husband is pretty laid back and i’m not  so i guess it’s no shock that he’s generally the good cop  but scary when he’s angry  and i’m more shouty bad cop  but suddenly good cop when daddy gets mad   but on other things — fundamental parenting issues — we had no idea whether or not we’d be on the same page until we got into it   thankfully we both agree kids need routine  and my husband used to get up in the middle of the night to help with feedings and changed as many nappies as i did   we also both value date night away from our kids and believe that while our children are our priority  we also need to have adult time  where we watch a movie  even on a laptop in bed  or have dinner together  i was relieved to find that he doesn’t feel i should always put the kids before “us ” that our relationship needs watering  too   as regular gym-goers  we are big believers in kids doing sports  in fact  my husband is now the manager of my son’s cricket team  this however  is not something i could have predicted  as much as my australian husband loves the sport  he hates any kind of attention and isn’t into “managing” people  so seeing my anti-social other half being chatty with all the cricket team’s parents makes me giggle  it’s a side of him i had never seen before   which proves that parenting brings out many things we might not have known about our partner   i once read a book where a rabbi told an engaged couple that there are only two things you have to decide upon before marriage   1  do you want kids   2  decide what religion you will raise them in   that was it  now  since becoming a parent  i’ve realized there are so many more topics that my husband and i should have discussed before getting married   we never talked about how we would handle our kid having a meltdown in the supermarket   we never discussed who would take responsibility for filling out our kids’ school applications  or buying their uniforms  or organizing their parties   in the life partner we pick  we know that they likely have a similar outlook and shared values  but translating that into parenthood is a completely different scenario   for example  i knew my husband has a sugar addiction  but i never expected him to be so against sugary cereals for breakfast  he’s like the breakfast police  making porridge until it comes out of our ears  likewise  my husband knew my love of halloween  but he probably didn’t expect me to start planning the yearly halloween party in early july   when you go from a partnership to a family  you’re entering an unknown zone   having kids  someone once said  is like throwing a grenade into your marriage  you just have to wing it  but there are some things that have helped my husband and i do this   1  we try not to contradict each other and speak as “one voice” to the kids   2  we try to have sacred family time  usually around dinner  where we all talk about our days   3  we try to understand when either one of us is crazy busy with work and try to compromise and help each other   but still  we are human and often have arguments about who is the most tired has done the most   these are fights we never had before kids  but it all comes with the joy of parenthood  you can never predict how it will all work out with your kids  as you don’t know the kids you are going to get  you don’t know the needs they will have and how these needs will test you   and more importantly  you don’t know how you’ll get all of your different personalities to mesh together to make a family  but the joy is in this daily challenge — and to me  simply nothing comes close diy confession i got jealous of my own flower art pin  pinterest and i  we have a love hate relationship   beautifully styled and lit pins spark an overwhelming stream of happy emotions  but  i have also awoken in the middle of the night in a cold sweat — panicking that i forgot to pin that mini hot air balloon wedding centerpiece  and now my big day won’t be absolutely perfect    i know that sounds crazy  but you are who you are  and i’ve learned to embrace my neuroses    one normal pinning day  i found a pretty photo of a flower  used as a brush to create an artsy painting  moments after hitting “pin it ” my inbox was flooded with repin notification  after notification  since then  i’ve received over 1 600  each feel like a “subtle” hint to try this flower art diy   i get it people  you really like this pin   so what’s a girl to do  well  because i’m a little very high-strung  i couldn’t just take this lying down  no more staring longingly into the abyss — i snapped on my smock and got to work  recreating the pin people loved so much  and gosh darn it  they would like mine too   here’s hoping my photo gets just as much love  repins welcome    you too can create pinterest gold  read on for the step-by-step tutorial  using only the flowers in your backyard and supplies in your home  it would also make for a perfectly messy but heartwarming toddler craft   supplies   paint  i used acrylic  plate flowers  with 3-5 inches of stem left intact cardstock or watercolor paper paintbrush  optional   directions   step 1  squirt paint onto a plate  if too thick  dilute with water and mix together with a paintbrush   step 2  swirl flower around in the paint   step 3  place on paper  feel free to stamp  swirl  or brush to create different patterns   even try different types and shapes of flowers for variety   or use your brush to paint in between the flower strokes   step 4  once done  let dry  frame  hang  and enjoy i was jealous of my perfect mom friends  i have a couple of mom friends who are perfect  at least in my head   they are thin and pretty  they have glamorous jobs making piles of money  husbands who worship them  close families and gorgeous  talented children  these women get to travel and stay in fancy hotels without their children  and because they can afford babysitters and spa treatments  they never look frazzled and frayed at the edges   their grey roots never show and they don’t know the pain of hiding their cracked  calloused heels in beat-up keds because they skip around all summer in  expensive  bejeweled flip-flops enjoying their fresh pedis   i used to really envy them   it started with facebook  as i struggled to get my daughter to sleep each night  i’d scroll through my newsfeed and find that again  my perfect friends were on vacations that  for me  would be once in a lifetime  on these dream trips  my friends would pose on tropical beaches or poolside at four-star hotels  and they’d be wearing string bikinis looking as if they’d never given birth  and i’d think  “jeez  i didn’t even look like that when i was 16 ”  then they’d make comments about skyping with the kids who were  of course  having an amazing time at grandma and grandpa’s house while mom and dad frolicked around the world  and actually got to sleep in  like they did when they were still dating  and it would make me want to attack them with a hatchet   slowly  my envy consumed me until i became bitter and began to resent my friends   i couldn’t resist making snarky comments on their photos  in person  i was sarcastic  i withheld compliments and became critical of everyone  especially myself   why did i have to have parents who couldn’t babysit   how come we weren’t millionaires   why couldn’t i lose weight and look like that in a two-piece   why was i such a loser that i didn’t have a six-figure job   the more i let these thoughts intrude  the more they took over my life   pretty soon  i didn’t even recognize myself  women i’d once loved to spend time with  i now hated  it was almost like i enjoyed hating them  like being mean to them leveled the field  being nasty didn’t make me feel better and when my anger finally boiled over and i publicly lashed out at a friend for leaving her daughter for yet another whirlwind  adult vacation  she told me off for being judgmental and unfriended me permanently   getting dumped was embarrassing  but i deserved it  this was my rock-bottom  being called out on my envy became the wake-up call that i needed in order to change   “friendvy” can sneak up on you before you realize it  but the good news is that it can be overcome   when we desperately want what someone else has  it is always about us and never truly about them  we cannot control the luck of others or the fairness of life  but we can control our own reactions and we can examine our lives to find a solution and feel fulfilled   my envy was low self-esteem in action  when i saw my friends “having it all ” i took it as a chance to celebrate my own inadequacy  to get over that feeling  i had to figure out what was actually lacking in my life   the root cause of my envy was surprisingly simple  i needed a break   i was bored and burnt out from parenting  i’d been stuck in my house for too long with a sick kid  that’s why i became enraged when i saw my friends vacationing alone   finally  i spoke up and asked for help  which i hadn’t done before  i told my husband and my friends that i really  really needed a break  and while a hawaiian vacation was out of the question  we found realistic solutions  for instance  some of my “perfect” friends were more than willing to babysit  one even shared her nanny with me for free so i could write at her house during the afternoon   i was angry at myself for the way i looked and because my career had stalled  so instead of looking longingly at my friends who were fit and rich  i decided again to turn my focus inward and work on those parts of my life that maybe i’d neglected  when i did that  i was too busy to worry about anyone else  i didn’t level the field by snapping at my successful friends  i did it by creating my own achievements that i could be proud of   instead of bringing them down  i brought myself up   often when i lamented the apparent unfairness of life  people would tell me to remember that everyone struggles with something  while this might be true  this advice was only a little helpful  when we say this  we’re seeking to bond with others through shared suffering   friendships built on common pain aren’t as strong as friendships based on mutual support and celebration  i don’t want to feel better about my hardships knowing that people i like are suffering with something  too   i had to realize that there is enough success and beauty to go around   no one stole my bikini bod or the european vacation that was rightfully mine  but i was acting like they had  just because my friend made a half a million dollars doesn’t mean that i can never be wealthy  miracle windfalls can happen  right   a friend’s beauty doesn’t mean that i’m ugly  we can all be beautiful and we can all experience abundance  as long as we realize that abundance is relative  i have lots of truly awesome things in my life that make me lucky too  and when i change my perspective to focus on those things  it’s like all the bad stuff disappears because it’s shoved into the background  where it belongs   envy is one of the hardest emotions to deal with  unfortunately  life really can be unfair sometimes   case in point  i was born with a slow metabolism and there’s little i can do about it  sometimes it seems like everyone else got all the luck  but when we can shift our focus  work on ourselves  count our own blessings  and fill our own lack by asking for help  we can banish envy and experience the fulfillment of true friendship the surprising reason motherhood brought me back to church  when my 5-year-old son spilled half a gallon of chocolate milk on the kitchen floor last week  the first words out of my mouth were  “oh my god ” similarly  whenever i get my water bill  there’s a good chance i’ll end up saying  “jesus christ  not again” under my breath  and when i see something incredible that catches my eye  i can’t help but exclaim “holy smokes ” even when i don’t want to   despite my heavy use of religious euphemisms in my daily vocabulary  i don’t consider myself a very religious person  even though i grew up catholic and spent a few years at st  thomas apostles school in queens  ny  i never had a strong relationship with the church and only attended mass during important holidays   and apparently  i’m not alone   there are more and more americans now that are identifying themselves with non-christian faiths than ever before  our country’s religious landscape is changing  as many people are looking to unaffiliated faiths as an alternative to traditional churches or are simply choosing to be atheist or agnostic in their belief   to quote the forever hip michael stipe  somewhere in between my ignorant teen years and my aloof existence in my 20s  i lost my religion   it wasn’t because i deliberately dropped it  there just wasn’t a strong enough gravitational force to pull me through the church doors to begin with  i had other priorities  only if i had a really tough exam i needed to pass in college or got into an annoying fender bender or was given life-disrupting news did i call out to god   and while many adults my age are dealing with post-traumatic church syndrome  it wasn’t until i became a mother and started a family that the opposite happened to me   before i explain  no i didn’t have a born-again religious moment or feel in need of spiritual healing  and no  guilt didn’t make me start attending 11 am mass every sunday  it wasn’t anything complicated that made me think of my religion again   in fact  the answer is so simple that it might actually surprise you  too   in my chaotic  day-to-day life that includes work  marriage  and motherhood  i just wanted to find a place of peace  i tried to find it at my local yoga studio  during a quiet walk in my town’s nature path  or heck  even in my own screened porch  but i couldn’t find it in those places   so i went to the one place that i knew i could find some sort of solitude  and that was back at my church   now  i never dug too deep into the political foundations of my religion nor did i ever get carried away with the word of the bible or my priest’s weekly sermons  i listen  but i don’t absorb every word to my heart  unlike many devout catholics and christians of other religions  i honestly use my hour at mass to sit in peace   yes  that’s right  it’s a chance to sit for 60 minutes and not move one inch unless one of my kids has to go to the bathroom   during mass  all i want is my family sitting next to me in our pew  away from the computers  the ipads  the smartphones  and the chaos that we dive into every day at home   for me  going to church means i can just sit there and be alone with my thoughts without my daily distractions  it’s the one time a week i can truly thank god for the beautiful family that i have   it’s that simple   i don’t ask for a lot and i don’t expect to receive much  either  everyone has different reasons as to why they reach out to god  but for me  it gives my family an opportunity to bond in church when our otherwise busy schedules have us pulling in different directions   now  for my own children  i don’t plan on pushing them to go to mass every week like my mother did when i was their age  i feel as a mother it’s my duty to introduce them to our faith  but whether or not they chose to continue believing in it will totally be up to them   religion is a path that some people find steady all their lives  while others go off track  sometimes you think you lost it completely  only to rediscover it for the most unlikely of reasons 5 lessons about life every father should teach his daughter  how many articles have you read about a father being his daughter’s first love  about a 25-year-old who still refers to herself as a “daddy’s girl”  well  this isn’t going to be one of those   i adore my dad  but i recognize he isn’t perfect  he doesn’t keep in touch as often as he should  he gets grumpy if he doesn’t get his way  and his marriage to my mother ended pretty horribly   i wouldn’t  however  ever change him  he taught me the five most valuable lessons a woman can learn   1  don’t sweat the small stuff   when i was in school and panicking about exams  i turned to my dad for advice  my mother  while she always meant well  placed a lot of pressure on me to succeed   in the weeks leading up to my results  i was an anxious mess  rather than telling me i would be fine  my dad asked me to imagine the very worst case scenario   he pointed to people like richard branson  who’s extremely successful despite leaving school with minimal qualifications   he taught me that when you actually sit and think about the worst possible outcome  it probably isn’t as bad as you think  even if it is  you’ll get through it   2  always keep enough money aside to live for at least three months   when i was growing up  my parents didn’t have a whole lot of money  we weren’t poor  but we certainly weren’t wealthy  my parents carefully budgeted for everything   one of the key lessons my dad taught me was to always make sure i had enough money in the bank to live for three months in case the worst should happen   a few years ago  i really had to test this piece of wisdom  while i wouldn’t say i’m a great saver  i do always try to adhere to the three-month rule   3  be kind and put yourself in other people’s shoes   my dad is one of the kindest people i’ve ever known  he has the patience of a saint  when i complain about kids screaming on the train home or my neighbors being nightmares  he always makes me look at things from the other people’s perspectives   it isn’t always easy  but by listening to my father’s advice  i’m slowly becoming a better person   4  the best things in life are free   when i was a child  my dad encouraged me and my siblings to be creative  he would bring home cardboard boxes from work  and we would spend all evening making them into houses and forts   when i wanted to hang out in shopping centers with friends  he made me walk miles through the countryside so i would learn to identify every species of wildlife there was   he showed me the things that make us the happiest in life don’t cost any money  the things that really afford you happiness are using your mind  exploring nature and learning to love your surroundings   5  nothing lasts forever   this is the most important lesson any of us can learn  when i was upset at school  my dad would remind me it wouldn’t always be like this   when my first boyfriend and i broke up  my dad swore i would one day feel happy again  although i was convinced he was wrong    he’s also taught me to appreciate the good times because they  too  will pass  as my parents get older  this is a lesson i try to remember at all times  i want to value every day with them and ensure they always know how much they mean to me   and so  with that in mind  happy father’s day  dad alzheimer’s what children should remember when their father forgets  i can see the frustration in my dad’s eyes  and i can hear it in his voice  “what was his name  what was i supposed to do ”  forgetting happens more and more often   memories create a human connection to family  relationships and experiences   and  then  they get confused and disappear   dementia and alzheimer’s disease  my father forgets   my dad is suffering from dementia  and alzheimer’s is right around the corner  we have been here before  his father had alzheimer’s disease even before it was able to be diagnosed or recognized as a disease   i recall visiting grandpa every sunday  he was in a nursing home  bed bound  my dad held his hand and tried to understand where he was  what memory was he living  is there a way to make the connection and have a conversation about a time past   visiting a nursing home in the 1970s is the definition of depression  especially for a teenager   my dad likely felt the same  yet he went  after all  his father raised him and a family of seven  grandpa worked hard as a farmer  survived the great depression  weathered droughts  earned a living and made a difference   i wish i had the foresight to ask my grandpa more questions about his life  i was young  he was old  we had a relationship  but it could have been more   my dad seemed to know the stories  or maybe he just pretended  either way  he was there  listening and trying to decipher the experience his dad was remembering   alzheimer’s disease is a bully  it steals your dignity and your memories with no regard for what is cherished  it is scary in every way   my dad is scared of facing a similar fate  and i am scared  too  i’m scared for him  and i’m scared for what lies ahead for me and my memory   what will my dad remember   will he remember my third-grade surgery  my car accident in high school  or being there when i graduated from college  will he remember my name   i remember  for now  i remember his firmness and his compassion  i remember the harvests  helping driving trucks or shoveling grain  i remember his tender moments with my mom  i remember him standing up for progress when others wanted to maintain the status quo   i remember the spring planting  the dirt and our faith in the seeds of growth   i remember what he may forget  family is the memory keeper  each generation pulls something forward  good and bad  we remember  and we tell our kids  we try to be better  do better   our stories contain colorful characters  and memories embrace our hearts   i am unsure of my fate as a father  will i wander through my latter years trying not to forget  what will my sons remember   teens try to distance themselves from their parents  after all  greater independence is a strong call   my teen sons are now where i was over 30 years ago  how they view my interactions with my dad may set in place how they relate to me 30 years from now   the momentum of time continues  yet we see familiar mile markers along the way   i hope they remember when i forget  i hope they remember the saturday breakfasts with dad  or the long hike in zion national park  along with the good times  i hope they remember the struggles and how we tried to do what was best   they know  i believe  we were always there to guide  encourage  challenge and love them   the lesson of forgetting is to be present   family is an interdependent web of experiences and stories  and we need to be present  we need to ask questions  we need to have meaningful conversations   father’s day is a time to pause and connect with our dads  be present   fathers  do the same  be present with your sons and daughters  tell a story  share a past experience or plant a connection point  you will need these later in life   connection points are memories  they may be what remains as you hold your dad’s hand later on  searching for where he is   when you find the place  a warmness will fill your hearts how i plan to honor my father’s integrity through my own perseverance  it seems like everyone has a story about his or her old man to tell come father’s day   for most of us  it’s one of the few times a year our thoughts truly surround the men who raised us   i’m ashamed to say i do not think about my father enough  despite all the influence he has on me today   sometimes  when you are busy  especially if you’re a college student   thoughts are reserved for the immediate circumstances around you   but  i have a personal narrative to tell  it is one of sacrifice  perseverance and unconditional love   my father came to this country from vietnam with my mother and three children  they left their home to pursue economic prosperity  something many immigrants do in the search for a better life   although my family was given about six months to learn english in the philippines before moving to the united states  they did not have enough time to prepare for the journey ahead   here in the united states  my parents never had the opportunity to go to school and properly learn english   thirty years old with three children and another on the way  the top priority for my parents was to work and make a stable income to put a roof over our heads   growing up  i was upset my dad couldn’t be there for me all the time   because he couldn’t speak english well and only had a high school education  my father worked a low-end job at a furniture manufacturer   to this day  i still have never been inside that factory  i’ve never even really asked him about it   to help pay the bills and assist my siblings with paying for community college  my dad took another job at safeway   it was during these few years i saw him the least  he was working 80 hours a week  and the rest of the time he would spend resting for the next day   being only 10  i recognized the sacrifice he was making for our family  but i couldn’t truly grasp it   although it was hard not seeing him and being able to talk to him every day  i was conscious enough to understand there was reasoning behind the sacrifice   but  when he was away at work  he was also always with me   his disposition was ingrained in my character  my father’s hard work and perseverance are traits i learned and came to value at a very young age   although we lived a modest life  i came to appreciate the little and often overlooked things   i came to know my dad during the first couple summers while i was in college   at this point  he had moved past his days at the furniture factory and started his own landscaping business   my dad had first encountered landscaping through working for his friends  and he eventually made enough money to buy his own supplies and equipment   landscaping supplies are far from cheap  and quality mowers go anywhere from  500 to  1 000   out of anyone i know  my father understands the value of a good investment   he told me and my siblings time and time again to worry less about the debt we were taking on with college and to worry more about making something out of ourselves   repeatedly  he would tell me if i didn’t want to end up like him — working hard for others with little pay — i would have to go to college  to this day  these words still ring in my head   during those summers  i worked with my dad endlessly  i got to know him well — more than i had in the first 15 years of my life — just through being with him 10 hours a day   i asked him about his life back home and about how much he missed his family   we would talk about life  and he would ask me about my ambitions and friends during our lunch breaks getting pho   he would always buy me coffee in the morning  and we would always end the workday when he felt i didn’t want to work anymore   fast-forward to today  i am about to graduate from college at the university of washington   this entire year  i have worked full-time while balancing good grades  but i rarely get to go come for weekend trips   although my father has less of a physical presence in my life now  he continues to dramatically influence who i am   he calls me often  always asking me how i am and telling me to come home to visit  most of the time  i hear his messages through voicemails because i am busy either at school or work   after i leave my undergraduate years behind  the thing i am looking most forward to is not my future job prospects or how i won’t have to sit in lecture halls during sunny days   i am most excited to go home and spend time with the man who has showed me unconditional love  despite my inability to sometimes do the same   cheers to our fathers and our inability to truly express our gratitude and love toward them how my father’s mistakes taught me that time is never on our side  when girls talk about their dads  they usually lead with the familiar “daddy’s girl” narratives   their dads were first in line at their parent-teacher conferences  they sat front row during their dance recitals  and they coached their all-girls softball teams   their fathers taught them about success by the “watch and learn” technique  watching their dads kiss their moms before heading off to work every day  then bringing home the bacon at night   when i talk about my dad  i never found a relatable anecdote to lead with because my relationship with my father was far from the norm   when you grow up with an ill father  it’s difficult to find the right things to say when talking about him with others   of course  my dad was an incredible human being  he had passion  a heart of gold and an incredible taste in music and food  he had his flaws  however  just like every other father in the world   except  my father’s flaws got the best of him   in any situation like this  most kids would let their pain eat them alive  fill their hearts with disappointment and turn their backs on their dads  but  that’s just not the type of person i am   my father had a lot of failures  he made a lot of mistakes  and he had a lot of things he wished he could have changed   i know this because the last voicemail i ever received from him described just that   before my father died  he told me all the things he wish he would have done and the things he wished he could have changed   he wished he went to more of my parent-teacher conferences  he wished he sat front row at my dance recitals  and he wished he coached my all-girls softball team   as life goes  time often runs out before we are able to make the changes we want  to live the lives we dream of and to do the things we feel the most passionate about   growing up  i was often forced to witness things that changed who i was   i sat in the intensive care units at hospitals for months  talked to doctors about life-changing surgeries and helped my dad learn how to walk again   yet  i never witnessed my dad make the changes he wanted to  live the life he dreamed of or do the things he felt the most passionate about   was i disappointed  when i was young  absolutely  i was too young to understand all of the things i do now   my father’s mistakes and failures taught me the biggest lesson i’d ever need to succeed in my life  the supremacy of time   time is never on our sides  time runs out before we get to say what we want to say and do what we want to do   unfortunately  my father’s time ran out too soon   but  i am a product of my father  and i carry his name with me knowing this and inhabiting this makes me realize i can change his destiny   any parent wishes for nothing but happiness  success and good fortune for his or her children   even my father — while he spent several years in hospital beds  hooked up to machines constantly beeping and keeping him up at night — always wanted what’s best for me and my sisters   he just wanted to see us succeed in all the ways he could not   we all have the opportunity to take control of our lives  we are the captains of our own ships   time should not hinder us  but it should push us forward to do all of the things we believe   say what’s in your heart  do what you feel deep down in your soul and chase after anything that makes you feel alive   you never know when time will run out why i’ll always be daddy’s little girl  no matter age or distance  if you looked at my relationship with my dad on paper  you wouldn’t think we were so close   the fact that i’m a daddy’s girl goes against all logic   my parents are divorced  my dad and i live on opposite sides of the country  he’s type a  while i’m a proud type b   and this summer is the first time we’ve seen each other in two years   yet  if we go just a few days without talking  it’s a rare and a sad occasion  a relationship between a father and a daughter is delicate  but it’s one of the strongest bonds that exist   it is ever-changing  but it remains constant from birth until death   you can never get rid of your dad  you can have falling-outs  you can stop speaking  and you can even turn your back on each other for good  but you can never truly cut the tie connecting the two of you   well  at least in my case   without a doubt  i know i wouldn’t have accomplished what i’ve accomplished without my dad  whether he was helping me with my college applications  giving me advice about applying for jobs or just picking up my favorite snack at the grocery store  my dad has always had my back   i always think the role of a father in his daughter’s life is underappreciated  at this time in my life  when i am questioning everything from my future career to what color i should dye my hair  it’s nice to know i have one thing i don’t have to question  my relationship with my dad   there’s a reason why he was the first one i called when i got my internship  my wins are his wins  and my losses are his losses  we’re a team  he’s the one who tells me when i’m doing a good job  and he’s the one who tells me when i’ve got it all wrong   he doesn’t sugarcoat  he doesn’t embellish  and he doesn’t fluff my ego  he tells it like it is   and i need that in my life  especially now  when i overthink everything and constantly second-guess myself   if you’re like me  then you’ve reached the point in your life where you find yourself straddling childhood and adulthood  you’re trying to do the balancing act of being a woman while still feeling like a girl  and constantly failing  might i add    you disagree with your dad on more issues than you can count  yet you always seek his approval   you want his symbolic pat on the head to let you know you’re doing just fine  or you need his hug that lets you know everything is going to be alright  sometimes  you have to fight to keep that relationship alive   your 20s are a time of change  and that includes relationships with your parents  you try to make your parents proud  but you need to stay true to yourself  i’ve learned about the growing pains of parental relationships the hard way   whenever my dad tells me i don’t need makeup to look beautiful  or i’m the best daughter in the world  i might roll my eyes  but i’m smiling on the inside   and  while i may surprise my dad with my feminist beliefs  shock him with my choice of clothes or sober him with my growing maturity  i know he’ll always see me as his little girl   though i hate to admit it  as a daughter striving to be seen as a woman  that is the safest feeling in the world 10 lessons from having the worst possible roommates in the world  with all the wacky ways to find potential roommates these days  it’s never a surefire bet you’ll end up getting along with the people you live with   being a good friend  as i learned  does not always correlate to being a good roommate   in my four years of undergrad  i lived in six different locations   it’s not that i was indecisive  i just moved out of twice due to roommate issues that were so severe  my livelihood took a major hit   here are 10 things you haven’t thought about  but definitely should before you move in with a new person   1  don’t trust people who go through your things   one day  when i returned from class  i noticed my roommates moved my furniture and other personal items around the room   here’s what i learned  never leave anything of real value unattended until you completely trust your roommate   moved furniture or displaced personal items might annoy you  but it’s easily correctable with a firm discussion   sometimes things happen that are simply out of our control  often  these things anger us  frustrate us or leave us wondering why someone else might decide to intrude on us in a certain way   we may disagree or we may feel resentment  but keeping a calm head in these situations that make us feel violated will ultimately behoove us   2  no matter how social you are  you don’t want to live in the middle of a constant party   i’ll never forget one night when my roommate brought the party back to our dorm at 3 am… on a weekday  here’s what i learned  i wasn’t into partying as much as i thought   sure  i loved to go out  and even stay out late  but there was a fine line where the party stopped  and i assumed it was drawn at our door   when i laid down  i expected others to respect that  as ludicrous as i thought it was  they thought it was acceptable to bring friends back  turn the light back on and continue to socialize as i tried to sleep   3  a small living space is a recipe for disaster   living with three other guys in a hot and congested supply closet turned dorm room wasn’t ideal from the start  but combine that with roommates who stayed up late watching tv  doing homework and listening to music  and you have a melting pot that will boil over   here’s what i learned  not everybody likes to operate on the same schedule   ninety percent of the time  if you ask a roommate to quiet down  a reasonable person will likely attempt to accommodate you   though my roommates were not reasonable in the least  i learned that sleep was quite high on my hierarchy of needs   determine your priorities and decide whether you’ll be able to achieve those in the living situation you’re thinking of committing to   4  when you look at your roommate and see the devil staring back at you  you have a problem   perhaps this was brought on by roommates who talked back  you know  in that tone that just screams  “i don’t really give a sh t whether you’re happy… i’m going to do what i want ”  i almost couldn’t believe it  when i asked a roommate to make a simple adjustment to the angle of his desk light or to turn down the tv volume a few notches  my request was met with undue hostility and a refusal   i learned i never want to be that kind of a person  if someone else in my company is uncomfortable  why wouldn’t i defer to the golden rule   part of our purpose in living is to help and enrich others’ lives   i learned that considering others and ensuring everyone is comfortable is a pretty important thing   and  you know  not wanting to tear off your roommate’s head   5  there’s nothing worse than living in a pigsty   there’s truly nothing worse than looking at your kitchen or dining room in your college house  then looking outside at your trash pile in the driveway and realizing they look the same   i think my senior house was actually messier than the trash dump out by the curb the majority of the time   that’s because my roommates often left stuff — dishes  beer cans and other garbage — all over the place   they had no regard for the concept of cleanliness  sure  i may have left the occasional unwashed dish in the sink for a day or two  but i’m talking gunk so thick lining our kitchen floor  it felt like walking on glue   i’m talking a mattress in our basement covered in unknown fluids  clothing and dirt  i’m talking fleas in the kitchen and in the garbage   i learned that i’m a cleaner person than i thought  and i finally understood why my mother went to such lengths to keep our family’s home so spick-and-span   there’s nothing worse than living in a dump  make sure you have roommates who respect the sanctity of a fairly clean house if that’s something you want   6  living with terrible roommates will reflect poorly on you   striving daily to better myself in every aspect wasn’t easy when i was constantly surrounded by grime and stink and crap   if i invited over other guy friends to hang out  or perhaps women i was trying to impress  the last thing i needed was a trashed place to hang  ideally  you want your living space to be an extension and reflection of you   i learned that i wanted others to have a singular  classy  respectable view of myself  i learned appearances are important  especially when they’re god-awful   what self-respecting girl or down-to-earth guy would want to be surrounded by a bunch of assh les living in a sewer  uhh    well  i know i sure wouldn’t   7  money will always be a touchy subject when living with others  even if you’re already friends and agreed on the terms of your rent and utilities   how will you handle it when that friend  who is also your roommate  can’t get you or the landlord his or her rent   what about a roommate who refuses to pitch in for a new table  food or other items   what will you do when roommates tell you they “don’t have time” to go down in person to the power plant to drop off a deposit   worse  what if this person is you  don’t let it be   unfortunately  financial discrepancies are a quick way to lose friends and quickly build a wall of tension  i learned to strive for clarity on these issues   email works best  if you can  try to avoid being the point-person for any of the bills  but always pay your share on time  and offer to help meet your expenses   8  make no assumptions  and rule out nothing   i remember when i was desperate to find roommates senior year  i would have have lived with anyone who wasn’t a serial killer   thus  the guys i ended up living with represented basically four complete different ends of a four-pronged spectrum  we just didn’t mesh   i was so busy thinking about finding guys to live with  i never stopped for a second and thought about whether i really wanted to live with these guys   and here’s what happened  i assumed these guys would respect my space  be clean and wouldn’t disregard the landlord’s policies by smoking weed or cigarettes in the house   i really should have explored other living options that i hadn’t considered  like renting an off-campus apartment and living alone  which i ended up doing  while eating the rent i owed on my house    never rule anything out  and never assume that just because you’d do something one way  another person will also   interviewing a future roommate  even if it’s a best friend  will help to get some of these issues out in the open before anyone signs the dotted line   9  if you start to feel physically  mentally and emotionally unhappy  your life won’t be livable   this is how you know a change must be made  sleep  a roof over a clean house  good people  respect and happiness are some of the most important things for me to lead a productive life   when i felt so lost  and when these things were taken from me  i was pushed to the point of desperation   i would have chosen a broom closet rather than spend another night in that dreaded dorm room or that hellhole of a house   if you feel sick in this same way  you know you simply must put all of your cards on the table and make a change  of course  the best way to avoid this is to make really good choices about how you’re going to live   10  my crappy roommates did not even see the above issues as problems   it’s impossible to sit down and have a civil conversation about an issue when the person you’re attempting to reason with disagrees that a problem exists at all   my ex-roommates did whatever they wanted  with blatant disregard for others’ sanity   to me  this is no way to live life  i wish for others to enjoy being in my presence  not despise it   i highly encourage you to do your absolute due diligence in exhausting every possible living scenario for yourself so you can avoid the heartache i’ve described   after all  home really should be where the heart is 10 reasons to quit your job  move abroad and be an au pair  the summer after i graduated college  i was depressed  i had a good job  a great apartment and wonderful friends  but my mind never stopped nagging me that i never studied abroad   it was something i’d always planned to do  but i somehow never seemed to have enough money or resources to make it happen   so  the fall after i graduated  i did a little research  quit my job and moved to paris to spend one year as an au pair   it was terrifying and risky  and i had more than my fair share of ups and downs  but  i never regretted it for a second   here are 10 reasons you should follow in my footsteps and try it  too   you’re only young once   it’s cheesy  but it’s absolutely true  there is no better time in your life to take risks and have adventures than right now   maybe you have a carefully-constructed plan for your life  or maybe you have no idea where you’ll be in five years   either way  take advantage of your youth and liberty now because it won’t last forever   learning a second language   i had been taking french classes since i was 12  so when i first got to paris  i naïvely believed i could speak french   yeah  i was obviously wrong  but after a year of living in france  i became fluent   humans are wired to learn other languages  but note this will only work if you actually speak the language with people from that country   if all your friends are other aux pairs from your own country  like mine were at first  you probably won’t improve that much   you have the opportunity to travel more   part of the reason i wanted to go to europe to begin with was the opportunity to travel more   before living in france  i’d traveled very little outside north america   but flights within europe are incredibly cheap  and during my year  i was able to visit madrid  malaga  london  brussels and other french cities i’d always wanted to see   as a nanny  you generally have a lot of free time   obviously  this varies depending on the family you’re working with  but in general  kids are in school most of the day   so  you have most of the day to yourself  i didn’t have to pick up my child until 4 30 in the afternoon  which gave me almost the whole day to spend with my friends drinking wine by the seine and going to museums  mostly wine  though  if i’m being honest    new friends  duh    it’s true i haven’t seen them in a while  but some of my closest friends are the people i met while in paris   some were other aux pairs and some were parisian  but i wouldn’t have met any of them if i hadn’t gone   spending time with locals is literally the only way to learn how people there really live   it’s the only way to go to random and beautiful apartments where everyone brings a bottle of wine  and the night devolves into serge gainsbourg karaoke   it’s the best way to find secret spots with cheap drinks and live music  travel books just can’t do that for you   it’s a pretty cost-effective way to travel   if you’ve always wanted to live in another country  but you can’t afford to support yourself independently and have no real job prospects  au pairing could be the way to go   it’s important to do your research because it’s definitely possible to get taken advantage of   but my family was great  and they paid for my apartment  my navigo  public transportation pass   my french lessons  my phone and €100 per week for recreation   one hundred euros is not a lot  but it was enough to allow me to travel  eat  party and shop like a frenchy   food   french food is everywhere  but there is nowhere else in the world to get a real boulangerie experience — with fresh bread  pastries  sandwiches and snacks — all under €5   i’m convinced that to really understand a culture  you’ve got to eat like you’re a part of it   romance   i don’t know anyone who came to europe without a boyfriend and went home without having at least one breathtaking love affair  kissing on the grass under the eiffel tower  magnifique   new culture  new habits   living with people from a different culture  you pick up some of their habits without even realizing it   some of them are good  and they stay with you  while others you may leave behind   for example  french people have a small breakfast of tea or coffee with usually just toast or yogurt  guess what i eat for breakfast now   you’ll come back different   maybe it’s just that your local accent is a little less pronounced  or you suddenly only drink bordeaux wine  but there’s no way you come back the same person you were when you left   in france  i learned how to cook  i learned about french music and film  and i learned about the clashing political factions that are growing more aggressive with large-scale unemployment   living abroad automatically makes you a little more informed about the world around you  it’s not bad résumé material  either 11 reasons you have to be crazy to succeed in life  business and love  as awesomely different as hyper-successful people are  they have one super-thick  unbreakably strong  common thread holding them together as a united force of nature  they’re all bat sh t f cking crazy   i can hear your thoughts penetrating through the static screen of the computer   you’re teeming with irritation  rolling your eyes oh-so deeply  once again finding yourself offended that yet another girl is tossing around the term “crazy” with the frivolity of yesterday’s dirty laundry   not so fast  pc police  because i happen to love the term “crazy” and am going to use it with a fabulous  reckless abandon through the duration of this article   craziness is synonymous with success  so i decided to reclaim it a long time ago   if the ignorant masses of society are going to deem all those who unabashedly think for themselves  break free from the fashion norm and are madly burning with the blazing fire of inextinguishable ambition as crazy entities  well then f ck it and f ck them   let’s snatch the term out of their boring  basic fingers and re-empower “crazy ”  look at the great expanse of human history — haven’t all the game changers of love  life and business all been labeled crazy at one point or another in their lives   ernest hemingway  sylvia plath  steve jobs  angelina jolie  oscar wilde  sophia amoruso  lena dunham  james franco  laverne cox  salvador dali  andy warhol and karl lagerfeld are all gloriously out of the box   whether it’s love  career  art  relationships  activism or poetry — all of these notoriously “crazy” megastars have been massively groundbreaking and undeniably successful   i’ll take it   after all  “madness” is the ultimate breeding ground for creativity  and creativity is the driving force behind fresh  exciting ideas   and aren’t those “irrational” souls with stars in their eyes the ones who wind up finding true love   the true love everyone so dreams of attaining but never finds because he or she is blindfolded by cynicism and normalcy   aren’t the fantastic  colorful “weirdos” who speak their magnificently outspoken minds with marvelous candor of the universe the ones who become the international icons of the world   here is why   1  crazy people don’t give a f ck what other people think  crazy people are privy to the ultimate secret life has to offer  once you let go of caring about what others think  you’re free to do what you truly want to do   when you’re not shackled to the handcuffs of societal “appropriateness ” you will do what you please without fearing disappointing the masses   this gives you the courage to fearlessly embark on new business projects and recklessly dive into the arms of the love of your life  regardless of his or her gender  sexuality or what your friends and family think   2  crazy people think outside the confines of a box  most people reserve their thoughts into that of a tiny  minuscule  little box  a box is a square made up of four restrictive lines   crazy people attain the capacity to think beyond the confines of a box and instead find razor sharp edges and soft curves in everything   3  crazy people don’t know or care what the rules are  let alone feel the need to abide by them  “rules” were created by the imagination-less populous as a way to control brilliant  creative minds   people who are free of independent thought vehemently fear creative creatures — it’s the very reason books are burned and art is banned   how can you have a thriving  authentic love life if you’re following “rules” of the relationship timeline and protocol  and it’s not working for you or your partner   how can you be a good friend if you’re judging   how can you be a groundbreaking entrepreneur if you’re perpetually following orders and afraid to think beyond what’s already been done   4  you say  “no ” and a crazy person hears “i dare you ”  i dare you to tell a crazy person “no ” say  “no ” to a crazy  and he or she will simply take it as a challenge to prove your sorry ass wrong   isn’t it the undying relentlessness  the refusal to be shot down  the inability to settle and the downright confidence to keep trucking along after you’ve fallen rejected exactly what it takes to be successful in anything at all   5  crazy people are crazy enough to believe in themselves  it’s an insanely competitive world  the world is teeming with pools of incomprehensible talent   when we realize how huge this world is and how many masses of people are fighting for the same job  the same person  the same dream home — it’s enough to make us want to throw up our hands and give up   yet there are only few who “make it”– whose dreams come to fruition   it’s not because they’re more talented or brilliant  it’s because they’re the only ones crazy enough to believe they are  indeed  powerful and special enough to break through and be seen   6  crazy people aren’t shackled by the fear of failure  the pressing fear of failure is what holds us back from ever taking a glorious risk   we can’t imagine it’s ever going to be possible to recover after a cracked heart or the cold stone fist of rejection  so we choose to protect ourselves from love instead   crazy people aren’t afraid to fall  crazy people aren’t afraid to taste the concrete   they aren’t perfectionists  they understand there is nothing in the world that can’t be healed   they recklessly dive in  while the rest of us hide beneath the comfort of our 1 000-thread-count sheets  protecting ourselves from feeling the bad — but also from feeling the otherworldly good   7  crazy people don’t ask for permission  crazy people never ask for permission  they live by the saying  “i would rather beg for forgiveness than ask for permission ”  they go for it  maybe they’ll end up in jail  maybe they’ll end up with an oscar   maybe they’ll up married on a beach in fiji  or maybe they’ll end up starting a highly successful customized headband company — who the f ck knows   either way  the fear of getting into “trouble” doesn’t stop a crazy from embarking on a revolution   8  crazy people are glittering entities with heaps of star power  when i was a little girl  i used to get lost in wonder at what exactly it was that made actors “movie stars ”  what did these mega famous entities attain — besides talent and good management — that made society so deeply infatuated with them   as i got older  i realized star power lies in individuality  their success is a direct result of the fact that they don’t blend in  they’re something different  something we haven’t seen or can’t explain   9  crazy people are rich with wild integrity  every leader of every social revolution was called “crazy ” crazy people are unable to ignore the truth and be silenced in the face of adversity   10  crazy people are driven by passion  not money  when money is the ultimate goal  there is only so far a person can go   you may achieve financial success  but you will burn out  it’s not enough to sustain you   when you’re passionate  nothing can snuff out your fire  and inevitably  that will lead you to longer  more powerful success   11  crazy people are crazy enough to trust themselves  crazy people are keyed into their sixth sense  the inner voice  the gut  the heart  the instinct  we all have it  but most of us don’t trust it   this is where we go direly wrong  this is when we end up f cked over and in trouble   crazy people trust their gut and don’t intellectualize themselves out of it 12 reasons i ‘literally can’t even’ and i love it  in the past few years  the following words and phrases have become increasingly common  and overused  in every conversation between 15- to 30-year-old women   “i’m dying ”  “literally ”  “the worst ”  “i hate it ”  “i can’t even ”  “i can’t ”  so much so that everyone now must talk about how annoying and “ditzy” these people are  even “snl” got in on the fun and created a hilarious skit with host dakota johnson about coworkers who  “just can’t deal ”  guess what  i’m one of those 15- to 30-year-old women and idgaf how annoying i may sound   i  “i literally can’t ” on an hourly basis because life is hard and people are stupid  before you go and dismiss this perfect line  here are some reasons why it always works in every situation   1  i’m trying to listen   we all have those friends who won’t take a second to breathe while telling a story  myself included   making it extremely difficult to get a word in or voice your own extremely important opinion about something   saying  “i can’t ” takes less than a second  so  when my friend is going on and on  leaving no room for me to interrupt and speak my mind  i can always slip in a good “i can’t ” to which said friend could respond  “i know ” and continue rambling   2  i’m not listening   the above also works when i ultimately get lost in whatever my friend is going on about  this way  at least it seems like i’m listening   3  i’m lazy   at some point in the last 10 years  everyone decided to shorten every word possible  then we started condensing phrases   “i can’t” became an even more abbreviated way to express  “i can’t even ”  we are apathetic people  and heaven forbid we use a complete phrase when we can barely take the time to utter an entire word  e g  obvi  caj  totes  fav and any other term coined by your bitchiest friend    so i’m lazy  deal with it   4  it can mean so many things   regardless of what the full phrase once was  these two short words now have infinite definitions that can work in a multitude of situations   i could be referencing a hideous outfit  an outlandish action  something mind-blowing  the weather or just sheer confusion  there are endless possibilities   5  i’m incapable of having emotions   cue barenaked ladies  “i’m the kind of  girl  who laughs at a funeral ” my lack of emotion leads to a lack of caring  which ultimately leads to me not knowing what to say in certain situations   6  my vocabulary is that of a 14-year-old   to this day  i have no idea how i got into college  i’d say about 75 percent of the time  i literally have no idea what else to say   7  it ends a conversation   talking makes me tired since i tend to never shut up  i don’t have the patience to come to a full conclusion at the end of every story  i wish it were an acceptable way to end all college papers   8  it also can end a relationship   this goes hand-in-hand with the fact that i have zero emotions and  therefore  don’t know how to break up with people   the conversation typically results in me referring to the relationship as “this” while waving my hand between both of us  shaking my head and saying  “i just can’t ” note that this rarely works…  9  i don’t want to talk to you   apparently  some people refuse to acknowledge the combination of oversized sunglasses and headphones as the universal sign for “f ck off ” and need to be physically told that you “can’t even” handle speaking right now   10  life is hard   it accurately indicates my true lack of understanding of the world around me   11  you’re annoying me   i’m a cynical bitch  if you and or your conversation is annoying af  i will find a way to let you know how much i do not care   12  i literally can’t   aka  i don’t want to 5 instances that prove 30s-life crises are very much a real thing  if you look up “mid-life crisis” or “quarter-life crisis ” you’ll get a ton of hits   but  if you are in your 30s and are  most likely  going through a tormenting time  you will only find a few posts that won’t even begin to reflect the complexity of the life stage you are navigating   why is that  there is no other time during your life when you’ll feel more different than your peers and even your best friends   you have friends who are single  who have just entered relationships  who are married  who are divorced  who have kids and who don’t have kids   in my closest group of friends alone  there are single people as well as a couple with three kids  and they are all my age  what person am i supposed to relate to most   the fight between the rebel in you and the responsible version of yourself has never been more present   this is why your 30s are  in a way  your second adolescence   if you try to awake your inner teenager during your mid-life crisis  you don’t need much of an awakening in your 30s   the teenager is still there  you still do wild  irresponsible things  and you still feel like you don’t know a lot about the world  you still feel like you belong in a club or can come home drunk after a night out   but at the same time  the responsible part of yourself is getting stronger   you don’t even know when it crept up on you  was it a natural process  did society influence you  you don’t know   but  you suddenly feel you need to act more mature in ways  like by getting your own house  being more in charge at work and  ultimately  being responsible for another life   let’s start with the children   people without children start to feel the pressure from the ticking of the biological clock and wonder  “should i have a child now while i’m still young ” “is there such a thing as a maternal instinct  will my tell me what to do with my baby ”  young parents are frustrated they are no longer able to keep up with the not-yet-parents part of the group  and they don’t have time to nurture their inner teenagers anymore   let’s talk about work   if  in your 20s  it didn’t matter to you what you were doing as long as you were getting paid  your 30-something self starts to wonder  “is this what i’m meant to be ” “should i change my field of expertise ” “should i go back to school ” or “is it right that i’m still at the same position after working for so many years at this company ”  when it comes to your work  you feel young and old at the same time   you’re young because you still have 30 more years to work   is it really that much   and you’re old because you realize it’s too late to start learning again and compete with people 10 years younger than you   you’re young because you still dream big  you’re old because failing is no longer an option  as you have more and more responsibilities and people to look after   you’re young because you still want to run away from a bigger role  and you still make funny faces in the meetings   you’re old because you start having a lot more experience and ideas  and you want to lead and be part of the decision-making   how can we not speak about love   if you are single  this is definitely when you start wondering what’s wrong with you   you cannot stand your parents’ scrutiny anymore or being surrounded by couples who have nothing better to do than plan when to have their next child   if you are in a relationship  you feel the pressure to settle down  you obviously ask yourself  “is he or she the one i’m going to spend the rest of my life with ” or  “am i done searching ” i’m telling you  it’s not easy   burning desire for self-improvement   i truly believe it’s a bit like “limitless” in your 30s  your brain is at the peak of its functioning  but this comes with a downside because you know enough to realize you still have a lot more to learn  generation-y no longer defines the status quo by what they own  it’s by who they are   you ache to be the best possible version of yourself  the tormenting questions are  “do i know enough ” “have i’ve done enough ” and “what other dream do i need to fulfill ”  as a result  you start painting when you are 32  you start dancing when you are 35  you start a new master’s program when you are 34  or you quit being a teacher and start a life-coaching career   full-fledged “young and the restless” syndrome   “young and the restless” definitely had the best possible insight on this  it’s the perfect way of describing our 30s  but  does all of this restlessness leave room for happiness   well  if the above points didn’t hint at the obvious answer  there are studies that have correlated happiness with age  they have proven we go through a u-bend of happiness   in general  happiness starts to decrease after your 30s  reaches the biggest low in mid-life and then goes up again   does this mean we have to wait to grow old to be happy again  not necessarily  we just have to allow time for integrating the novelty in our lives   we need to observe how the things we have just learned or experienced are contributing to the way we present ourselves to the world   this way  feelings of pride and accomplishment can kick in and generate happiness   if not  you get a similar outcome to when you eat something too quickly  you don’t allow your brain the time to acknowledge your stomach is full  so you keep on eating   for instance  i’m keeping a monthly list of everything i’ve done  now i can look back  reflect on it and feel proud of myself  despite being in a middle of this awful yet wonderful 30s crisis  try it out  and remember  you are not alone in this 7 reasons why your life needs to fall apart  it’s important for your life to crumble into a million tiny pieces of garbage at least a few times   i’m not talking about a little bump in the road or a case of the mondays  i’m talking about those times in life when it all goes bad all at once  those times when the floodgates open  and every little thing that could go wrong does   those times when it all just seems too overwhelming to deal with   you wonder if the universe is playing some sick joke on you  and you dare it to drop just one more challenge on your already overflowing plate   you are officially at the intersection of “help me god” and “jesus take the wheel ”  seriously  though  you know those times  they’re the times you look back on and say  “yeah  i got through that ”  although we all hope and pray life’s storms will be gentle and leave us intact  those storms we endure are imperative to our growth as humans  they shape who we are and what we become   i would hate to imagine the kind of person i would be had i not weathered those storms or been faced with things i initially believed i couldn’t handle   while it may not seem like it when you’re in the trenches  it’s really important for sh t to hit the fan every once in a while   here are the reasons why   you gain perspective  when everything goes haywire  you will cry — a lot  you will sit down in the middle of your floor and sob big  heavy tears  and there will be a spot right in your core that will ache in the most painful way   you will think this is truly the end  and it couldn’t possibly get any worse   then  there is that beautiful moment when the sun slowly creeps out from wherever it was hiding  and you feel like maybe you can take on the world   once you have felt all of your feels  there’s an invincible sense of “newness ” and you suddenly gain a clarity and perspective on your life you hadn’t had before  you realize the small stuff truly isn’t worth sweating   gratitude  it’s hard to truly appreciate the blessings in your life when you have no sense of scale on which to weigh them   when things are bad  the things going well in your life are highlighted and become impossible to ignore   you learn to appreciate the little things you may have overlooked before  and you realize how much you’ve taken for granted  far too often it takes something tragic to make us appreciate the good   you find out who your friends are  tough times force you to reach out to your network of family and friends for support and guidance   asking for help is not always easy  but it shows you who is willing to sacrifice for you  even when it doesn’t directly benefit themselves   you’ll notice some people have a way of conveniently being unavailable when you’re going through it and somehow reappear after you’re back on your feet   delete  delete  delete those people   you are creatively inspired  we all know the best country songs come from a place of heartbreak  and some of the most famous artists have created their best works during their darkest moments  think picasso’s blue period    even if you don’t consider yourself a creative type or an artist of any kind  there is something about being in a low place that inspires creativity and new ideas  how those ideas are channeled is up to you   you are better able to empathize with others  no matter how good of a friend you are  it’s tough to really empathize with others going through difficult times when you haven’t experienced any hardships of your own   while it’s not always necessary to truly be able to say  “i know how you feel ” it helps you to better serve and encourage others when you have faced a struggle or two yourself   you realize your strength  as clichéd as it is  it’s true  what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger   the resiliency of the human spirit is truly amazing  and one of the most empowering feelings in life is surprising yourself   you get a serious sense of power when you come out on the other side of a series of challenges you believed were simply too much for you to handle   you emerge stronger than you went in  and you are that much more equipped to deal with whatever else may come your way in the future   you learn to trust and let go  there comes a time in the midst of the storm when you realize you have very minimal control over things   there is only so much planning and prepping that can occur before you realize it’s time to let go and trust the dust will eventually settle and life will indeed go on   it often takes a lot of hassle to get to that point  but when you do  it’s like the weight of the world has been lifted   you are truly able to take a deep breath and say  “what is meant to be will be ” so much wisdom and strength comes from truly learning to trust and let go 7 reasons you should know and love yourself before someone else  it’s frightening to think the ways we feel  think and behave can be so destructive  yet  without the right lessons or impetus to challenge them  we will continue to live in possibly harmful ways   my main fallacy has been this  i have never felt loved for being  only for doing   and over time  i came to the sad realization several others  like myself  saw self-worth as something that was earned   they did not see it as something inherent in every being  i noticed people were looking outward for affirmations about themselves instead of having them grow from within   whatever the cause and whatever the case  this is how i was  i was desperate for affirmation  thriving on compliments and praise and doing things specifically to garner the right kind of response   this is what my ex-boyfriend didn’t like and  ironically  tried to fix about me  the conditioned habit of seeing myself through the lenses of whomever’s eyes were pointing in my direction   he’d chastise me for dressing a certain way  for my social media obsession  for not being able to let a conversation end without my humor sprinkling the air   he was the type of person who had strong beliefs and principles and lived by those alone  call that narrow-minded  but it became something i grew to admire   consequently  i started to see why he hated the things he hated about me  i started to hate them myself   so  my journey to form my own self-schema ensued  but  this was quickly met with hardships i never anticipated   “what do i believe in  what do i think and feel  what do i even look like  how can i grow to like myself without even knowing myself ”  i was such a professional people-pleaser that i never recognized what pleased me  i was used to being lukewarm and fluid without substance or boundaries   i knew i had to take mental notes of my thoughts and behaviors and dissect the reasons behind them  it was sort of a pseudo-psychology experiment   here are some things i’ve found  and am still discovering  through this journey to “do me”   1  schema is ever-changing   as we are never the same  our environments are never the same and life is never the same  it’s important to see yourself as being in constant flux and in harmony with the universe   it is  if anything  unideal to have strict definitions that may hinder your growth or close yourself off from opportunities that lay outside the circumference of the aforementioned imaginary “self ”  my desire to define myself enlightened me this way  you cannot define yourself  you can only know yourself   self-awareness in whatever state you are in — short- or long-term  fleeting or significant — is the first step to self-love   it’s the first step to not crumbling every time someone else tries to touch something you’re sure of  it’s the first step to not base your value on others’ opinions of you   okay  i don’t yet love or hate myself  but  i can say that i know   i know what i like  what i believe in  what i’d die for and what i don’t really care about  when i’m presenting things now  it’s not because i think i’ll elicit a certain type of impression of myself   it’s what i actually feel at that moment  i think it’s important for us to be a little more honest and a little less reluctant to share what’s going on in our minds   and  of course  we should be confident it is coming organically  rather than from external pressures   something i’ve noticed recently is people will gravitate toward you more the more “yourself” you are   i’d always been drawn to people who stayed true to themselves  and i always found myself attracted to those with quiet  humble self-awareness   but  i was never able to practice it  over time  the less contrived i acted  the more comfortable i felt  and the more comfortable i made others   all the positive attention i worked so hard for came naturally to me  people would tell me things if they thought i could relate   people would pay me compliments for sincere efforts  people i wanted to be around wanted to be around me   maybe the reason why — even when i was a quite successful “attention whore” — i still felt worth very little was because positive energy is meaningless if it’s contrived   “thanks for thinking i’m great  but i’m only a great actress ”  i’m sure some people hate me  and to those who do  cheers to you  c’est la vie  to each their own — whatever floats your boat   i’d rather be hated for what i am than loved for what i am not   so  this is huge  it’s huge and never-ending  the transition from someone who thought she had to offer help  laughter  time  money and sex in order to feel like anything at all to someone who could just feel worthwhile breathing and existing is incredible   i would love more love in my life  i am open to it  want it and crave it  but  i will never ask for it   2  free yourself from the concept of “deserving” anything   when i was younger  i would lie in bed at night  cringing at the thought of all the injustices in the world  poverty  famine  endangered species   i would internalize every problem  large or small  as personal afflictions  i imagined myself transporting from region to region  crusading against evil   but instead  i was crippled by my smallness  aware any action i took would be inconsequential in the grand scheme of the never-ending wrongs in the world   i didn’t envision myself as a failed hero  i probably wasn’t even as concerned with all these tragedies as i’d like to think   rather  i was mainly frustrated by my inability to control a situation i saw needed fixing   i hated that i was powerless  i was powerless to set the equilibrium of the universe back to the way it “deserves” to be   do people deserve to get hurt  did victims of rape and murder deserve that  do we lose loved ones in natural disasters and freak accidents because we deserve it   the more i’m exposed to the random atrocities that plague this world  the more i want to reject the idea that anyone deserves anything   if the world functioned in a way where people got exactly what they deserved  we’d have no need for prisons  courts  hospitals or heartache  some things just happen   the same frustration with my powerlessness i felt as a young girl stayed with me and eventually manifested in my relationships   but  there are so many fallacies involved in trying to play god with other people   by attempting to take control of people’s feelings or the situations surrounding them  we assuming   “because i’ve been through  blank   because i feel this for you or because i’m willing to do  blank   consequently   blank  needs to happen ”  some people just love  and some people don’t  sometimes  we break our own hearts for other people  and sometimes it’s not enough   not only is it horrendously unsound to view human relationships as such a mathematical exchange  but even if they were to pan out  what good is a love you have to ask for  a love you feel entitled to   the more contrived it is  the more you’re contradicting yourself  if you feel you truly “deserve” something  should it not come organically   if someone loves you  it’s real  whether you deserve it or not   3  people don’t belong to each other   because i was constantly doing for love  i couldn’t trust love existed in other people unless they actively expressed it  i’d try to manipulate the ways they could show it in a way that i saw it  but   1  it’s not practical to expect others to speak the same love language as you do   2  even if people love you to death  they still don’t owe you anything   so  of course  you can’t control how much or what kind of love you get  you can only act on your own emotions  express love as you feel it  and welcome its reciprocation   i felt like i owed people something because they claimed to love me  i felt i had to earn that love  even if i was told it existed at no cost   i didn’t know how to be still in love  i was so convinced the moment i stopped working for it  i’d lose it   “i love you for you  you don’t need to do so much ”  i expected so much from people without realizing these expectations were self-projections   i felt inadequate in so many areas  so i relied on everyone else to compensate for the shortcomings i did not want to admit  let alone accept   the very last time we talked  he said  “control what you can  let the rest just be  that’s all we really can do ”  4  “goodness” is largely subjective   for a long time  i obsessed over calibrating my moral compass to the “right” direction  i thought i could only find self-worth if i became someone deserving of it   over time  i started veering away from the idea there is  even specific to an individual  a strict set of moral codes that deem you “good” or “evil ”  it is an illusion that sometimes good people do bad things  and bad people do good things  we are all just people doing things we think are okay  there are no real “good” or “bad” people   i have done some extremely questionable things in the past  i have also been selfless and helpful  this does not make me a sinner nor a saint  i just did the best with what i had   perhaps altruism is less defined by the things you do  and more designated by what led you there and your ability to stand by your decisions   even disney villains  when their stories are explained  make the audiences feel for them  we empathize   once we see how the “evil” ones turned “evil ” they no longer become “evil” in our eyes  they’re only relatable  likable  even   we are all struggling enough with the harsh practicalities of life and dealing with nebulous and unanswerable questions about whether we are good  deserving or worthy   with all the time i’d wasted trying to figure out how i could be good  i wish i had realized i am  despite all my mistakes and shortcomings  i am good   5  desire is not love  need is not love  dependence is not love   it was difficult to realize i didn’t need someone to spoon-feed me my self-worth   what i needed was someone who empowered me to feel like i could stand on my own two feet  with or without the person   ironic as it may be  the best way to love someone is by making him or her realize he or she doesn’t need it   i used to think “love” consisted of this immovable  unquestionable higher power that bound two people to each other   having a say in whom or how much you loved seemed unromantic   all the nuances that come with dramatic  movie-like or heartbreaking love depend  to some degree  on the notion of “meant to be ”  to me  love as a choice didn’t seem like love   but  i’m learning love as a slave to your own desperation isn’t love at all   would you want someone who loves you helplessly out of a reflexive response to his or her “need ” or would you want someone who loves you because he or she just loves you   elevate your partner to know better   those who are “needy” have  for one reason or another  grown conditioned to believe their happiness derives from another person   and those who perpetuate that “neediness” are the ones who give love like candy  instead of showing their partners they are capable of cultivating their own gardens   i shouldn’t need you  you shouldn’t need me  either   i am me  and you are you   and if we decide to love each other  fully as we are  it will be beautiful   it’s really the only way   6  relationships thrive on mutual giving  receiving is simply a side perk   although you may love giving for the sake of giving  a struggle many selfless people go through   you are often confronted with the imbalance of the reciprocity   if your partner is purely a receiver  over time  you’ll think about how little you’re left with  and it’ll disappoint you that   1  you neglected yourself  and…  2  the person you gave to never once thought to give back   and after you realize that  you’ll start pulling back from people  you’ll think twice about loving and caring because that’s what keeps draining you   yet  giving is in your nature  and denying it hurts  too  and  you’d have to settle not just in receiving  but also in giving   there are many components in love language  all of us have preferences and idiosyncrasies that make us interesting and challenging to love   but a general  overarching rule is to not pay attention the the give-take balance  but rather to the give-give threshold   giving feels good  and so does receiving  but if we focus on both quantities  one of which you really have no control over  you’ll drive yourself crazy   7  first  be well   we hear it all the time  but i don’t think we realize how literally and powerfully this translates to real life   your relationship with yourself sets the stage for every single relationship you have with others   you can’t love  respect or appreciate anyone else without first feeling it for yourself  you can’t give away anything you’re not sure you even have   how beautiful would it be if we each took the time to center ourselves  what if we devoted more time to realizing our self-worth rather than comparing and judging   we need to be confident in the cores of our beings instead of settling as insecure  nebulous characters who only exist in the context of others  vulnerable and dependent on external influences   no one is your enemy  and no one is your savior   how beautiful would it be to act with love and respect — no matter how any else treats you — because you are loving and respectful   how beautiful would it be if we could love and love those around us and never run out   if we could inspire a love so pure  infectious and radiant that we’d almost forget it started humbly as a love for ourselves 7 things you realize during the month after graduation  today marks exactly one month since i donned that hard-earned cap and gown  managed not to trip on stage while shaking hands with my school’s president and accepted my diploma   i did forget to switch my tassel as i walked offstage  but hey  minor details    although only 30 days have passed  it feels like another lifetime ago   everything is so different now  but it’s hard to explain why  it’s not better  and it’s not worse  it’s just different   i haven’t admitted it  but waking up early  actually having to look nice every day and commuting an hour to my big girl job has been an adjustment   on the one hand  i feel more grown up and independent  and that’s exactly how i felt when i started college  too   maybe that feeling just comes with every new stage of life   but on the other hand  i miss my apartment  my roommates and my days of not moving until noon   i’ve had some reoccurring thoughts since graduating from college  and i don’t think i’m alone   here are the things that cross all our minds after becoming college graduates   1  we catch ourselves thinking  “when i go back to school in the fall…”  i’ve had this thought so many times  and each time it hits me i’m not going back  it’s still jarring   i think this is the biggest realization that has yet to sink in because right now  it just feels like every other summer break   when people start going back in the fall  i think we will really understand college has ended   2  when it comes to student loans  we find ourselves thinking  “a six-month grace period is a long time  i’ll be able to save during that ”  student loans never seemed like real money to me — until i started doing the math  then  suddenly  it was very real money  especially on an intern’s wage   i’ll be the first to admit i’m bad with finances  i’ve always known that  but now  it actually matters   i just thank god i’m not paying rent at the moment  or i would be curled up in a ball and crying 24 7   3  we realize we no longer get student benefits   we no longer qualify at the gym  at the movies or wherever else it’s beneficial to be a student   unless  of course  we have one of those great student ids that does not include a year and has a recent photo  not that i would know    4  if we’ve moved back home  like many college graduates do for a short while  we know it’s an adjustment in itself   after living on my own for four years  it’s been hard to re-condition myself to do little things  like telling my parents where i’m going or sharing the car with my siblings   i’ve had a few bumps in the road during this period of readjustment  but i assume that’s normal  mostly  i’m just so thankful my parents aren’t charging me rent   5  we feel like we have no friends because everyone is so spread out now   we used to be able to just run next door to borrow a shirt or chat  but now  our closest friends live in different cities   we’ll likely never all be in such a close proximity again  and it’s depressing  really   6  dressing like an adult still feels a little too much like playing dress-up   i suppose it depends on what the job is  but my big girl job requires me to look presentable every day   that means i can’t just throw on jeans  a t-shirt and flip-flops  and i live in flip-flops during the summer    wearing real shoes  sometimes with a heel  and tromping around the city hasn’t afforded me my finest moments   i am not graceful  and i do not feel elegant  i feel like a little girl in her mom’s shoes that are too big on her  and everyone knows it   7  waking up early will never be okay or easy   i fully milked the whole scheduling my own classes thing and made sure not to have anything before 11 am  i’d stay up until 1 or 2 am  and then i’d roll out of bed at 10 am   all was right with the world  now  i stay up until 1 or 2 am and wake up at 6 30 am   in other words  i really need to rearrange my sleeping schedule  for my own sake and for the sake of those who spend time with me   so yes  graduating is an adjustment  we just have to keep reminding ourselves that high school was an adjustment  and then college was an adjustment  too  and  guess what   we made it through those  in fact  we did more than make it through  we thrived  and we had a hell of a time  and that’s what real life will be like  too   i have a feeling we will still miss some parts of our college lifestyles  and that’s okay how cooking with my dad helped me heal after my mom’s death  my mother was an incredible cook  i still crave her oven-baked salmon  her spaghetti bolognese  her blackberry cracker and whipped cream tarts and even her famous salad dressing guests constantly requested the recipe for   my father  like many fathers  could throw together a mean barbecue and maybe fry some eggs on a sunday morning  but he didn’t do much else   he bought the bagels for brunch  and he offered to make the occasional sandwich   if my mother was ever held up  and he had to throw together dinner  every vegetable in the fridge became an ingredient for a giant salad  topped off with a can of packed tuna   but cooking  it wasn’t dad’s thing  the kitchen was my mom’s   my mother passed away three summers ago  as it happens when someone dies  people were bringing us food for weeks  neighbors showed up with platters of deli sandwiches   friends brought crockpots full of meatballs in sauce  for a while  my father  sister and i were well fed by the kind gestures of others   but then september rolled around  and my sister returned to college   then it was just me — a recent graduate living at home again — and my father  on our own  and the biggest question every night was  what do we eat   it started out rough  in the beginning  there were a lot of barbecues  pasta nights and  of course  dad’s everything-in-it salads   we tried costco frozen prepared salmon in little packages and frozen ikea meatballs with frozen fries   it was okay  but every night felt like we were throwing something pre-packaged together or recycling the same two meals we knew how to make   nothing felt truly home-cooked  nothing felt like it was made with love   finally  i’d had enough  i had recently started a job at a lifestyle magazine  and i spent a large portion of each day browsing recipes and food blogs   most of them were extremely daunting  herb-crusted rack of lamb with heirloom potatoes  no way    but every now and then  i’d stumble upon a recipe in the “under 30-minute meals” or “easy weeknight dinners” category  and i’d think  “hmm  i could make that ”  dad went grocery shopping every saturday morning  and one saturday  i decided to go with him   with me  i brought a printout of a recipe i’d found online  sautéed pork cutlets with parmesan   the ingredient list was simple  mostly things we had in the house plus the cutlets and some herbs   but  we enjoyed scouring the grocery store aisles together  trying to figure out the right kind of meat cut and where the heck they kept the fresh parsley   that night  i assumed the role of head chef  and my father was my faithful sous chef   he chopped the parsley and juiced the lemons  i placed the pork in the pan and  fingers crossed behind my back  watched it fry   the look on my father’s face as we took our first bites that night is something i will never forget  accomplishment   the meal was delicious  but more importantly  we had made it from a recipe together and without help  from there  it became a weekly tradition   every saturday  we’d go to the grocery store together and select the ingredients from a new recipe  every sunday  we’d work together to cook it   along the way  we had plenty of fails  the salmon with olives and fennel left much to be desired  and the time we made a tuna casserole  we were stuck with leftovers for four nights in a row   but  each time we tried a new recipe  we spent hours together pushing the cart in the grocery store  chopping vegetables side by side at the kitchen counter  and googling what a broiler was and how to zest a lemon   eventually  we made that roast rack of lamb  and it was incredible  it even looked  dare i say  fancy   when i think of my mother  one of my biggest regrets has always been that i never asked her to teach me to cook   she was so wonderful at it  and it would have been special to one day cook the things for my children my mother had made for me   i don’t get to go back in time and do it  but i know something else  if my mother had taught me how to cook  my father and i would have never bonded over figuring it out  a missed opportunity became a gift i feel lucky to have   i have since moved out of my father’s house and am living on my own now  fledgling cooking skills included   but my father  my sister and i have an ongoing group text where we share photos each night of our solo cooking adventures  an attempted country-fried steak  a cheesy bowl of bacon carbonara and the occasional everything-in-it dad salad   we haven’t quite mastered it  but we’re trying  and the trying is what keeps us together   i imagine my mother is in the group text  too  and she smiles at each photo  proud of her little chefs that keep it going   and now  when i’m feeling hungry  i crave the meals dad and i would make how i learned to appreciate my father 5 years after his death  it’s interesting what time can do to you  you can go to your high school only a few months after you’ve graduated  and it will already feel foreign   you can come home in october from college  but that certain sunny yet cold and slightly windy weather will make you feel like you’re cutting class in order to prep for the homecoming parade again   it’s weird going away and coming home  and whether you like it or not  it will feel familiar   i was sleeping in my bed  it was probably around 1 am  i used to sleep with my door open  and my sister slept in our guest house because she wanted her own private space  my parents’ room was on the other side of the house   i thought i saw the lights go on in the hallway and heard the garage door open and close  but i was half asleep and didn’t really care to investigate   i woke up the next morning and was washing my face in my bathroom when i heard a small knock on my already open door  my sister came into my room and had trouble quietly telling me that our dad passed away last night    “oh  okay then ” i went back to washing my face   i splashed cold water on my face and looked up into the mirror    “well  this isn’t going to be a very good day ”   i turned around to wipe my face with my towel and realized i couldn’t seem to dry my face  i was crying  against the wall  face buried into my towel  i didn’t know what the f ck was going on with my life  or why this was happening   “who loses her dad right after her 18th birthday  he should be celebrating his birthday next month  i don’t understand  he wasn’t even 50 ”  what was my mom going to do   my mom woke me up and asked me to drive her to the cemetery  i usually make up some stupid excuse and try to avoid it   i have issues  i can never force myself to go to the cemetery and see him  it makes everything too real  you know   granted  the absence of his presence in my life is a very real thing  but like i said  i have issues   driving an hour and a half to clean out the old flowers and put in new ones  to do the korean tradition and pay respects to him by bowing on our knees twice  to lie there and look into the sky and the sun  it’s just not my thing   i don’t like it  as tranquil as it sounds   i’m trying to grow and improve consistently as a person  though  so this year  i didn’t put up a fight with my mom and said  “sure  let’s leave in 20 ”  i went into my mom’s room  and she was lying in bed  i told her i was going to school  and she said not to  of course  i told her i had to go and that i had something or other to do  i just wanted to focus on something normal  something real rather than this nightmare of my father having passed away  she didn’t try to stop me  and she said to go if i wanted   as we finally got ready to go  i walked outside  and the weather outside was  well  the weather  i live in palm springs  so february is nice  it’s not too hot  not too cold  and it’s nice and sunny with a little breeze  it felt exactly how it did five years ago    i got to school and said nothing  but my teachers already knew my pops had been in the hospital for a while  so  when my first-period teacher asked me how he was doing  i broke down instantly  my best friend ran to me and held onto me tightly  my teacher said i could stay in his classroom all day if i wanted to  and he called all of my other teachers to let them know    my friends and i sat in the asb room for the rest of the day  my friends’ parents sent over food to the school  and i got texts telling me they were sorry for my loss and they were there for me   there was no traffic because it was a tuesday  so we got there quickly  my dad’s grave is at the top of this mountain  so we were incredibly high up and surrounded by peacefulness  we changed the old flowers and put in new ones  set out a blanket and did our bows  my mom and i layed there for a bit  it was a gorgeous day  the sun was shining  but it was a good 68 degrees or so  the sky was super super blue   i was lying on my back  just staring at the sky and trying to block the sun from my face when i heard my mom mumble something   i thought she was talking to me  so i said  “what ” she replies  “we’ll be able to just get up right now when we’re leaving  get up from lying down  but  your dad can’t  it’s such a shame ”  the day had ended  everyone was very empathetic  i realized what an amazing group of friends and teachers i had  who else could say her whole faculty and even her principal were sensitive to her current state   but  i didn’t want people asking if i was okay or if there was anything they could do    the answer would be no  i’m not okay  and no  there isn’t anything you can do   it’s not your fault  but you’re asking me these questions i don’t want to politely answer with sugarcoated lies  so  instead  could you just ask me if i did the homework  or ask me if i was excited for my dance competition next weekend  or ask me if i had gotten any acceptances into college yet    at least i could give you a real answer    my mom said we should go  she had an appointment at 2 pm  and we had just been hanging out there for a while  so  with that  we said our goodbyes and that we would be back soon   when we got home  my mom said  “wow  five years  what have we been doing for five years  what did you do in these five years ”  i graduated high school  i missed my dad  i missed my mom because she wasn’t in la when i went to school there  i danced  i had an interesting dating life   i grew up  kind of  still happening   i tried to become a better person each day  i dyed my hair a couple dozen times  i interned in korea  i graduated  i got into grad school   and here i am  just kind of living and sh t   but  the thing i learned in these five years is that i’m selfish  my father didn’t even know what colleges i got accepted into   he wasn’t there to see me graduate high school or even college   every third sunday in june will be spent double tapping pictures of other peoples’ fathers and resenting the fact mine isn’t with me anymore   he won’t be there to walk me down the aisle or to have the traditional father-daughter dance   he won’t be able to see any grandkids  he won’t be here for me  and it bothers me so much that i ache   it’s annoying that things have to happen to people in order for them to act better  why do you have to lose someone to start acting nicer to the other people in your life   it may be a cynical thing to say  but i just don’t get it  like why do you have to wait until thanksgiving to tell someone you’re thankful for him or her   or  in this situation  why do you need father’s day to tell your dad he means something to you with a long post on social media and a gift card to lowe’s  i don’t understand this type of logic at all   i guess i can only hope my experience can shed light on your current behaviors to anyone in your life  not just your dad   rather than waiting for something to happen — something to break you — and something to elicit appreciation once it’s too late  why not just try your best to currently appreciate someone   the choice to change starts with you i wore a strap-on for a week to know what it’s like to have a dick  i had a dream i was f cking someone  not getting f cked  f cking   i had a dick and a hard-on and an insatiable urge to have sex  i was thrusting  pulsing and f cking like a man   then it was over   i woke up and realized i’d never actually know what it’s like to have a male orgasm — to come every time   i’d never know what it’s like to be a male  what it’s like to be number one  the dominant sex  the pronoun carrier  i would never know what it’s like to hold something so treasured  so sacred  so goddamn important   then it occurred to me  like some women have done for thousands of years  i could fake it   maybe if i had a dick  i could understand why men continue to behave like them  maybe if i had a dick  i could stop being treated like a pussy   if there was anywhere i was going to go to get a true strap-on  it was babeland  no questions asked   with the support and selection at babeland  i was able to choose life-like strap-ons of both flaccid and erect penises to wear throughout the day  i wore the flaccid one inside a pouch sewed into a pair of spandex boxers throughout the day and night   and if i were to get the chance to actually use it  the erect dildo came with its own harness and own set of rules  but  unfortunately  i did not find a willing participant   so there it was  strapped on  sitting there  bulged and big  my skinny jeans tight around it  but i was doing it  oh yeah  it felt like i had a d ck   as liberated and confident as i convince myself and everyone else around me i am  i can’t deny that even if i don’t care what other people think  i still notice   i still notice what they’re doing when they look at me  how they react to me and once in a while  okay  maybe more  i do fall victim to their judgment   so when reviewing my diary of the seven-day penis trial  i noticed most of the points made were how i reacted to the reactions of those around me   and those reactions came to shape the entire experience  so here’s exactly how it went down with…  my boyfriend  i promised my boyfriend i wouldn’t wear the dick for his birthday weekend  cue eye roll and the beginning of what would be great insight into the male ego    i then found myself fighting with him over the right to wear it in bed   he’d ask me not to as if he were asking me not to text my ex  he’d make me feel like i was actually disturbing him  my fake dick making his sleep less likely and straining our relationship   when he hugged me in the morning  he jumped away  as if he’d just found a spider crawling up his stomach   i asked him what was so wrong with feeling something there   his exact words were  “it’s like coming into work every day to a designated parking spot  and one day  you come in  and there’s a car in your spot  it’s just… disorienting ”  i asked him if he’d still like me if he found out it was real  since he’s inherently honest  he just refused to answer   strangers  it was monday  and i was on the subway  the long cardigan i wore to cover the bulge had risen above my hips as i grabbed the handlebars of the moving car   the man sitting under me was at direct eye level with my silicon masthead   he looked at it  i looked at it  i looked at him looking at it  i looked at him squirm in his seat  i looked at him look down  i looked at him look at it again  i looked at him look at me  and suddenly  i felt uncomfortable   even though it was fake and i was playing a role  i felt like i was doing something wrong  i felt bad about myself  i felt exposed   i got off the subway and found myself hiding it whenever i walked  awkwardly swinging my hands in front of it  hunching to keep it from looking so prominent   i didn’t walk down certain streets once i got off the subway and made sure all the pants i wore were baggy and loose   my friends  obviously my friends were happy to hear about it  my fake dick adding spice to their monotonous routines of work  bad tv and vodka sodas   but when it came to actually talking about it  looking at it or going out with it  they weren’t as accepting   they laughed  they joked  they fooled around but never actually asked me how it felt  never asked what it was like   i was the butt of the joke  the anecdote at cocktail hour and the comic relief during moments we didn’t know what else to talk about   my coworkers  there were few people i told about the experiment  and of those few  all were women   they understood  being other writers and inherently original people   but when it came to walking around the office  making myself coffee and going to the bathroom past the guys who sit on my path to the women’s door  i found myself hiding it even more so   i could only imagine what the men of the office would start rumoring if one of them saw a strange bulge protruding from my skinny jeans   i thought about telling them but realized i didn’t even want that attention   fake or real  i didn’t feel like having their eyes on me  or it  i walked past my own peers hunched and uncomfortable   i didn’t stand and talk to any of them unless directly approached  and then  i usually shied away very quickly   by the end of the week  i found myself desperate to take it off and get back to normal life   what i found wasn’t about being born male but being born uncomfortable  being born outside of your skin  being born against how you want and feel you are  being born with something attached that isn’t attached at all   i can’t begin to claim to know anything about the struggle of transgenders from seven days with a fake dick  but i can say i’ve unknowingly walked a few steps in their shoes   i felt the awkward tension of hiding something so many men are proud to expose  i felt the burden of not feeling like my true self   this isn’t about caitlyn jenner  this isn’t about “orange is the new black ”  this isn’t about lgbtq month  it’s about something that happened accidentally that coincides with our need to understand purposefully   and that became that  i know this was supposed to be about f cking and feeling like god’s gift to earth and assuming once i put it on i’d understand why women should get paid less and why i want to f ck everything that moves  but i’m happy it turned out this way   i’m happy i unknowingly entered another state of understanding  gained another point of empathy   i’m happy that instead of just finding out balls really do sweat and men really are threatened by fake dicks as much as real ones  i found out about the real struggles and the real complexity of gender and sexuality   i’m happy babeland so generously provided me with the opportunity to strap on and walk a few miles in someone else’s dick money isn’t everything 7 reasons ‘writer’ is the best job there is  if you are an extremely creative person who is not ashamed of sharing your life experiences and perspectives  or if you are always trying to be a better person and get better in every way possible  you should definitely be a writer   writers must be empathetic to everyone  and understand the good and bad in someone  too   as a writer  you will learn to respect people’s actions and realize it’s just a reaction to the struggles that formed that perspective of life   here are a few perks of this job   writers truly realize the immensity of the words “never” and “forever ”  as you grow as a writer  you start realizing the immensity of those words   after all  forever isn’t just the last two seconds in a disney movie where the main characters are happy  forever is a very long time   things have a way of constantly changing  so to forever feel one way is just impossible   the same thing goes for the word  “never ” most people seem to think it’s just a way of saying not right now   but  considering the continuous changes that happen to us on a daily basis  this word is too meaningful to waste on things that may vary  like your thoughts and personality   can you actually say you have the exact opinion about everything as you did when you were a child    writers acknowledge they do need money to survive  but they also realize it’s not the most important thing   money is important in today’s society  but even though capitalism may disagree  it is not the most important thing in the world or in life  it is just a way to survive   writers acknowledge there’s more to life  and try to live as well as possible  even with the eventual struggles of life   writers see their own sadness and solitude as inspiration to create   it’s no secret that writers often feel inspired to write after going through their own personal hardships  as this is something brought to public attention by writers for decades   in writing  you get to embrace all of your emotions  not only the bad ones  emotions can be used to create on a canvas just as much as inside pages  whether they are negative or positive   writers can work from anywhere and have a flexible work schedule   one of the best things about being a writer is that you can write from anywhere  as long as you take your laptop or a notebook with you   you don’t have to go to an office every day to execute the same old job at the same time  or have a predictable life   you can travel and enjoy where you are while you’re working   writers are working adults who actually get to use their creativity and perspective — and get paid for it   as a writer  you can constantly be in touch with your inner child  it doesn’t die because of obligations and responsibilities   you can write from the perspective of anyone — both adult and child — and create any character you would like   writers can work in their pjs   usually  there’s no such thing as a dress code when you are a writer  if you are a freelancer  no one will stare or judge you and your life choices if you show up to work on your pjs   after all  you’re probably doing most of your work from home     writers get to know at least a little bit about everything   writers nowadays must read and research all the time to have enough information to write excellent articles on any topic   after a while  you discover something that interests you  and start focusing more on it   it doesn’t get boring  you will get a new topic to write about every day  and there’s always a new writing style to learn   need an extra push  what if i told you writers get to do to cool things  like go to concerts  meet their favorite celebrities to interview them and even travel for research for free no new friends 8 reasons your social circle dwindles by age 25  yeah  i used to wallow in weekend parties — lampshade on my head and everything  you know  seven shots in and you’re still amped for the night and your social skills are effortless   then one day  i sat in my room after a productive day at work  wondering who to call to indulge in some well-deserved revelry   i mean  it was 5 o’clock somewhere  and considering i’ve abandoned my social life  i knew i’d be unceasingly scrolling through my contact list   i haven’t talked to helen in what feels like decades  so that’s too desperate   sara’s too crazy for me  i’d probably come home five days later  after a spontaneous trip to cabo and a tattoo that gloriously cries out  “badass bitch ”  david… who the hell is david   i wasn’t 19 anymore  and i did indeed delight in my rite of passage  but  my priorities have adjusted  i quit smoking  and my threshold for tolerating people had phenomenally withered in size   my life appeared a lot less exciting  extremely busy and all i wanted to do was come home and catch a break   i was about that life  but  as the weekend nights got younger  i got older  and my friends became acquaintances  if not strangers   here is how and why your friendship circle will dwindle by the time you turn 25   1  the grind   our jobs are the main deterrents when it comes to our social lives  they are the main filter in extracting who we make time for and who makes time for us   we work hard to pay our bills  and after work  we want to just spend time with our loved ones or burrow in our own solitude   our jobs are also the doorway to new relationships  we spend more time with our coworkers and older friends turn out inadvertently on the bottom of our inboxes   we don’t mean to  it just does works out that way    2  the turn up   finding solace in our saturday nights involving a hodgepodge of boozy  irresponsible decision-making and nocturnal drunk texting  is no longer on our agendas   if we want to turn up  we’ll do it in bed  we don’t mind   some of us lose interest in it sooner than others  and along the way  we’ll lose heather to partying  and joey from work becomes conveniently more available for coffee dates   constant partying gets dreary  today’s pop music fails to harmonize with our fancy footwork as it used to  and two shots of jame-o means bedtime   having this much fun feels awkward  and we become exhausted when it’s not even 9 30 pm   3  new relationships   new relationships happen and can certainly put a strain on old friendships   your single buddy jason resents you because all you want to do is spend time with your new girl   it becomes trickier when your new babe brings in her friends  whom you eventually befriend  and then you find yourself caught in some unfaithful clan-choosing war game   prepare yourself to choose and upset others   if they were really there for you  they’d understand  if you were really there for them  you’d make time   4  the change of heart   over time  our values and interests change  maybe you no longer want to engage in juvenile activities involving a walmart shopping cart and illegal fireworks   meeting girls at local dive bars isn’t a thing for you anymore  you just want to meet the right girl and settle down   you are left with an awakening perspective and want to quickly attach yourself to maturity   5  the limited patience   when we’re so busy with life  we make room for responsibilities that matter and have less room for fluff   consequently  our patience lessens for bullsh t and toxic relationships   we stop hanging out with the liars  the flakers and those who slow us down   we prefer to surround ourselves with positive vibes and those who encourage us to thrive in life  we become selectively social rather than openly social   6  the stimulants   rosie has 20 friends  she subtracts the booze and recreational substances from her lifestyle   how many friends does rosie end up with  rosie ends up with two friends   it’s going to happen to you if it hasn’t happened already  when previous debauchery lobbied people together  you might find that was the only thing that you all had in common   7  the social media   according to clickz  the older millennial generation occupies a higher usage of social media platforms than other generations   this welcomes us to communicate with others easily and quickly  facebook  along with its other accomplices  instagram and google  is a reason why friendships dwindle in substance   suddenly  a facebook post on a friend’s timeline suffices for a real conversation  in recent days  it does   but  do you get to embrace the look on his or her face when the person tells you about his or her recent engagement   did you fathom the heartache the person experienced when he or she disclosed his or her mom didn’t win her battle with cancer   we love social media  and it comes in handy when we have friends overseas  but it can appear misleading  it’s where false intimacy is harbored   8  the miles in between   some of us will spend our entire youth and young adulthood in the same city while some of us will become travelers or passionate vagabonds   distance makes the heart grow fonder and… go yonder   “we’ll keep in touch ” really means i’ll send you an email twice a year  and “nothing’s going to change ” means it’s going to change   that evening  i realized that if i wanted to meet up with a friend worthy of my time  it shouldn’t require me to scroll through my phone and complicate the moment   it should just come to me  i learned that i had grown less tolerant of people  more particular with my time and a little snooty   call it a quarter-life crisis  but this is the point in my life of achieving some sort of clarity   some friendships will die  some will stay  but the ones that last will be the only ones that matter   as semi-functioning adults  our relationships with people will be only as lasting and valuable as we make them  especially considering all of life’s curveballs the snooze button is the perfect metaphor for your commitment issues  each morning  as the sun begins to slip through the cracks of my hideous chocolate brown curtains  i am harshly woken by the horrendous sound of my iphone’s wretched alarm   you know the sound  it’s the classic iphone alarm ring that gives you anxiety every time someone’s phone rings   why do you have that f cking sound of all sounds as a ringtone  assh le   anyway  the alarm goes off  and i try to open my eyes  i know i have to get up  it’s time to get up   it’s 7 15 am  and i have places to be  i know this  i am well aware i have a job  and i have responsibilities i need to tend to today   yet  without fail  i reach over to my cell phone as it simultaneously vibrates and rings  and i hit the snooze button   this little dance goes on for about 45 minutes  every five minutes  the alarm goes off again  and each time it does  i hit the snooze button   the snooze button  the easy fix for all things annoying   it ends the alarm for a short period  it isn’t permanent  the alarm will go off again  it’s just like putting a band-aid over the gaping wound that is your morning routine   the snooze button is actually a very depressing  very spot-on metaphor for my commitment issues and every other commitment-phobic person’s relationship issues   you go to bed  you tell yourself tomorrow is going to be a killer day  you’re finally going to get your sh t together and act like a real adult   you set an alarm because you’ve made a commitment to a goal  you are going to get up and be somewhere on time… but you can’t do it  instead  you keep hitting the snooze button  attempting to push off the inevitable   it’s the exact way you act in relationships  always setting lofty objectives and then completely f cking it up because you suck at seeing anything through   you mean well  but you’d rather lie in bed for five more minutes than face the world outside   if you don’t hit snooze  it means facing your issues   you know any relationship problem you have is not going away  but if you ignore it  you won’t have to deal with it right away  if you get up and face it  it’s scary   it’s a lot easier to just avoid things  just like with that dreaded shower and long commute to work  if you hit the snooze button  you don’t have to be bothered with it for another five minutes   you always end up giving up when things get too messy   in relationships  you tend to throw in the towel whenever things get too complicated  who has time for feelings  you have very little patience for inconvenience   it’s the same with your mornings  you know getting out of bed will have to happen eventually  but it sounds so hard  you’d rather just go to sleep than deal with anything stressful   you just don’t give enough of a f ck about anything to make anything stick  you want love  but you don’t want to work for it   mornings are hard  relationships are hard  you’d rather hit snooze and just… not   you never want to open your eyes   you are unwilling to put your heart into anything  so you can’t open your eyes to new possibilities  you end up trapped inside of a box because you’re too terrified to break free  you don’t want to get hurt  so you don’t take risks   it’s just like on those sleepy  early mornings  you do not want to open your eyes and see the harsh reality of the day  you get anxiety wondering if this is going to be a bad day   you’re never really starting anything because you’re constantly delaying things   when it comes to love  you go in with good intentions  but then you end up ruining it because you put off making any kind of real commitment  you cancel plans  you shy away from labels  and you just sort of flounder   all of your relationships end up fizzling because you can never muster the energy needed to make them thrive   you press the snooze button  delay the sh t you need to get finished  and nothing ever really gets completed   you always think something better will happen in five more minutes   you never lock anything down because you’re always waiting for the next best thing  if you commit  you’re afraid you’re settling   what if you embrace the cuff  and then something better comes along  and you miss it  just like with your alarm  you just have to wait five more minutes because the best is yet to come   you’re never fully single  but you’re never fully taken   you have relationship add  you are always talking to a few people at once   you’re definitely not taken  but you’re not really single either  you always have a few things going on  but you always get to do whatever you want   when you are torn from slumber by your alarm  you don’t fully fall back to sleep when you hit the snooze button  you just lull there in bed  half asleep  half awake  always a little bit of both but never fully invested in either   when you finally summon the ambition to move  you’re already behind   in the rare case you actually do decide you want to pursue something  you’re already behind in the game because you jacked around for so long   you’ve spent so much time being lazy and apathetic that you don’t even know how to function properly in a relationship   when you keep pressing the snooze button  you’re getting instant gratification  but you’re f cking yourself in the long run   when you set things back  you’re setting yourself up for failure   you’re now going to be late to work  which will put you behind and mess up your entire day  you’re already on the wrong track from the very start third-culture kids 11 signs you grew up with the world as your home  we third-culture kids might seem a little strange  but can you blame us  we spent the most formative years of our lives away from our families  our countries and just about everything else familiar to us   speaking for myself  the experience shaped me into the person i am today — though it wasn’t always easy   here are 11 signs that you’re definitely a third-culture kid   1  answering “where are you from ” takes a lot of effort   this simple question is supposed to be answered in just a couple words  but as third-culture kids know  that’s impossible   by the time you finish explaining where you’re born  where you grew up and where you are now  the person asking is either confused or bored  yeah  sorry about that   2  your family is concerned about your accent   almost subconsciously  my accent changes wherever i am living  as i moved between korea  hong kong  india and the united states  my accent morphed in each new country   when i’d return home  my family teased me when my korean sounded much different than before   alternatively  when you meet someone new  he or she will have no idea where to place your accent  that can sometimes be amusing   3  you adopt certain parts of each culture   every country does things differently  and it’s only when you leave the country and learn a new culture that you get enough perspective to see what works and what doesn’t   in korea  i love the closeness of the family  in hong kong  i love the intense  inspiring  and a little intimidating  work ethic  in india  i love the kindness people show their guests   in the united states  i thought highly of the sense of freedom most people have when it comes to deciding what to do with their lives and careers   there’s definitely cultural overlap between these countries  but i’m grateful for having the chance to adapt and learn in each place i lived in   4  your family tries bringing you back to your roots   my family wanted me to study outside of korea  but they definitely didn’t want me to forget my heritage   whenever i’d return  i’d be overwhelmed with korean-ness in an attempt for them to get rid of some of the “strange” habits i picked up abroad  it was all out of love  but it wasn’t always subtle   i can see where they’re coming from  the more time i spent abroad  the more i forgot the nuances of my culture   5  the world feels a lot smaller   when you’re in a different country  surrounded by people from all over the place  the world starts to feel a lot smaller   no country seems particularly exotic  and no person seems too different  i learned that despite our backgrounds  we’re all similar in our desires to find happiness and live good lives   6  culture shock becomes too strong of a word   culture shock is defined as the feeling of disorientation when you experience a different culture for the first time  for third-culture kids  this sensation is definitely muted   there’s always a learning curve  but there’s nothing shocking about it  it’s just a part of life   7  for better or worse  there is a psychological impact   we might be good at adjusting to culture shock  but all this moving around does take its toll   i always looked forward to coming back to korea  but each time i felt a little more detached from the culture of my family   this isn’t an uncommon feeling  as many third-culture kids suffer from a bit of an identity crisis   8  your family celebrates several cultural traditions   the funny thing is  as much as my family tried to retain our cultural traditions  we still adopted quite a few aspects of the different cultures we were surrounded by   growing up  we celebrated all sorts of different holidays and traditions  pakistani  korean  chinese  indian and american   sure  it was strange  but as clichéd as it sounds  i wouldn’t have had it any other way   from the packets of red envelopes filled with money for chinese new year to flying kites during the festival of kites and even decorating our family christmas tree  my childhood was filled with an assortment of cheerful festivities   9  you have multiple teams to cheer for in the world cup and olympics   while most people only have one team to cheer for  you can spread your cheers to a couple different teams   growing up abroad  we don’t usually have the same loyalty or sense of patriotism as the people who never left their countries   during the world cup and the olympics  things become simplified and we can just support whoever we’d like   if one team loses  there’s always a backup option   10  travel becomes “just a thing ”  as most people count down the days to a life-changing vacation  we’re a little more ambivalent  for us  it’s more about necessity   i always looked forward to new places and new people  but i never really felt the rush of excitement when stepping through immigration and into a new country   of course  i’d still sight-see as much i could in my downtime  it was just a different experience than what other travelers go through   11  you socialize way too much online   everyone seems to waste too much time online  but for us  it’s a necessity   we have a best friend in just about every time zone  making skype calls and online chats a nightmare to schedule   on the plus side  we’ve gotten really good at remembering the time in different countries to my heroic male friends thanks for making father’s day less tragic  as father’s day approaches  i can’t help but sit and reminisce  i think back to when i could hear his voice booming from the shower  the ridiculous red mustang he loved to drive  his endearing infatuation with eminem’s “8 mile” soundtrack and the bowls upon bowls of breyer’s chocolate ice cream we would share at night  all of  all of these memories are staples of my childhood  i think about the moments he has missed in these last five years  moments that would have — i hope — made him proud of the woman he helped to raise   it is these weeks around father’s day that just make me wish for one more minute — 60 more seconds — to soak him all up in my mind  lucky for me  though  i still have you   you would have loved my father  he had this personality that would have made you smile the entire time he was speaking   you’d be mesmerized by him and the way he wove his words into the most amazing stories   he was the type of man other men looked to for advice  women found comfort in and children absolutely adored   he embodied the definitions of humor  kindness  love  loyalty  whimsy and strength   he was a man who had an ability to be loved by everyone and love them all back   i know you would have loved him because i see him so clearly in you   i see him in you when you sing along to the radio in the car  in your sarcasm  in your moments of unbelievable ambition  in your ability to listen patiently to all of my crazy dreams  in the ridiculous dad jokes and in your bad dancing  i see him in our quiet moments  too   i see him in you when i am just seeking comfort  with your arm around my shoulders that lets me know despite the drama  hard times and tears  you are here to stay   through you all  i see him  you all stepped in  unknowingly  and have become cheerleaders  listeners  shoulders to cry on  the arms for the biggest hugs and the reasons for some of my biggest smiles   when i am with you  i get to hold on to all of the qualities i loved in him  my men help me to still feel like father’s day is a day i can celebrate with more fondness than sadness   know how much i value you for being by my side in these weeks when it might not have been the easiest place to be   i know this is hard to deal with from the outside  and i know i might take it out on you too much   i know i am not easy to understand right now and that my waters are difficult to tread   but do understand this  i adore you for just trying and appreciate you more than you know   in a time when i can’t help but remember a man who left my life  it restores my faith to know that i have ones who choose to stay   jared kushner seems to say it best   “the only things that are really permanent are love  family  friendship  and that is a lesson  at the end of the day  that’s really what it boils down to  the rest of it is just stuff ”  so  thank you for being my rocks  my brothers and my closest friends  thank you for making me feel like i can celebrate father’s day since  in little and wonderful ways  he was so very much like you 4 tips to get through your ’20-something syndrome’ unscathed  while you may not find the “20-something syndrome” listed on webmd  it’s certainly an epidemic in the dating world   here’s the theory  once a woman hits her early 20s  she may get the urge to be just like her single girlfriends and “have fun ” this means the poor sucker she’s with gets the boot   symptoms of this include excessive drinking  sh tty advice from single girlfriends and the urge to no longer feel tied down   or  as rita from “bridesmaids” put it  “that’s why every girl needs those slutty college years  to experiment  get it out of your system  find out what you like ”  but  if this is becoming an epidemic  does that mean we should fight or embrace it   i’ll be the first to admit i went through a brief phase of the 20-something syndrome   my best friend had just ended a four-year relationship  and thanks to the combination of a carefree summer  drinking wine almost every day and the distance i felt in my own relationship  i soon grew envious of her single life freedom   luckily  however  when i tried breaking up with my boyfriend  it didn’t go as planned  he resisted and told me what i had been feeling all along  i simply wasn’t being myself   it took time for me to get it together  but thank god he stuck around  i finally detached myself from that confusing phase of my life   and i’m not the only one who has gone through it  countless of other girls — and even guys — are currently experiencing it or have already come out on the other side   if any part of the above description sounds like a description of you  here’s how to deal and make a lasting recovery   curb the alcohol   i know  i love a glass of wine just as much as  well  anyone  but excessive drinking only made my situation worse   i was acting off my drunkenness and making stupid decisions as the result   partying may seem like the “thing to do” in your early 20s  but it can seriously lower your inhibitions   you act reckless and become addicted to the lifestyle  and it can cause some of the plainest guys to look like channing tatum’s twin  something no girl wants to find herself fooled into    once i got drinking back under control  it was like the fog cleared  i could get back to being myself and fixing the mess i made   find your clarity   your clarity brings you closest to your true self  your wants  needs and desires   all of this can bubble to the surface once you’re ready  you just have to be patient getting there   when i got my clarity  it was like a jolt to my system telling me to please wake up   i followed my gut instincts and called off throwing away a serious relationship just for the single life   don’t let others influence you   while your friends’ single lives may seem all glamorous and exciting  it isn’t always what it’s cracked up to be   don’t allow yourself to get so swept up in what they’re doing that it influences how you feel about your own relationship   those single friends may even be envious of what you have  you never know   as the old saying goes  the grass is always greener on the other side   embrace the process   regarding the question of fighting or embracing the 20-something syndrome  i think it’s best to embrace it  again  it’s all about listening to what you truly want   whether it’s remaining in a relationship or choosing to be single  only you can know exactly what you need in your life at this point in time   so  embrace those feelings  make your decision  and roll with it 6 reasons your bff is the best wing woman you’ll ever have  when you finally trade in your sweats for an lbd and make your way out of the apartment  you never leave for the night without one major accessory  your wing woman — more commonly known as your best friend   just like guys suit up their wingmen to help them score anything resembling a chick to take home  your wing woman is there to guide you through the drunken haze on which men you find acceptable to strike up a conversation with   with the two of you being so close already  the position of wing woman becomes second nature  but  what automatically designates your best friend as your wing woman   aside from the fact that you’re single  shaved your legs and are ready to mingle  your best friend and you are not only sisters  but also have your routine down when you enter any bar or club   she knows your likes and dislikes when it comes to alcohol  men and bar locations   here’s why your best friend is the best wing woman you’ll ever have   she knows the type of men you like   without saying a word  you know your best friend has spotted one of the hottest guys in the bar for you  she goes into full-on eagle eye status  sans screeching    you easily recognize the look  you see her eyes widen and the not-so-suave nod toward mr  handsome who walked in behind you  look at you  smooth operators   your wing woman knows the kind of men who tickle your fancy and doesn’t suggest anything less   there’s a guy who’s over 6’2” and has a man bun  don’t worry  she’s already spotted him and has a plan in action   the best part  she isn’t trying to climb this guy  so there is no competition here  instead  she finds a way to strike up the perfect opener to introduce the two of you   she will always save you from the creeps   there are always different variations of your typical bar creep  the watcher  the i-bought-you-a-beer-and-now-won’t-leave  mr  fedora  etc   navigating your way through these waters can be a bit challenging if you’re by yourself  but  with your best bitch by your side  your fear is gone   having a guy as your wingman would make things a whole lot easier when warding off the creeps  but you also run the risk of everyone at the bar thinking you two are an item   your wing woman will also pretend to be your lesbian lover if some guy doesn’t get the hint to take a hike   they say strength comes in numbers  and in this case  it’s incredibly true   she knows you need three things on your night out  a good flirt  gin and hot dogs from the food cart outside — and you aren’t leaving until you get all three   she will tell you if your lipstick is smudged   there is no one else in this world who will tell you when you’re wearing too much blush  or that those pants really do make your thighs look bigger  besides your mother    your wing woman never lets your perfect appearance fade on your night out   you two know it’s hunting season and she has a job to do  she has backup safety pins and extra mac gloss to save you in your time of need  she’s like your own personal stylist   like any good wing woman  you two are on the same mission  to find you a man — for the night  a lifetime or until 2 am   she fills in when your date bails   somehow we live in a society where men still stand women up  that’s a whole other article  of course that sucks  but she’s there to quickly fill in the missing  ass hole   once you grieve this assh le’s disappearance for a solid 20 seconds  your wing woman shows up to start the night  turning your frown into pursed lips around a pint glass   her job is to make sure your hotness and outfit — which you spent two hours deciding upon — aren’t wasted   her selflessness on your night out is shining bright  making you love her that much more   she doesn’t judge you for having that third  or fourth   judgement is something that has no place in the relationship between you and your best friend   if you’re on the prowl for the night  your bff knows you need a little liquid courage  in fact  she encourages it   she has shots lined up  and you down ‘em faster than a bag of reese’s pieces  there is no worst case scenario here   if no men are worthy to be your prey for the evening  you simply have a night out with your best gal pal  getting drunk and being silly together   if you do hit it off with a guy  you can now get to know each other in the presence of comfortable company   just be sure to pop in a mint  no one likes beer breath    your wing woman is also your designated drinking partner  who helps you get the night started  bad mood  feeling bloated  had a rough day at work   all of the negativity fades away and is replaced with good vibes and inside jokes   most importantly  she’s your bathroom buddy   it’s an unwritten rule that women must go to the bathroom together  especially in a bar   how could we possibly miss overhearing drunk conversations or watching a chick put on her romper on backwards   this small amount of “break time” from the bar is always present at some point in the night   sometimes we don’t even need to pee  but we go to check out our “on-the-prowl” style   if you choose a man as your wingman  you can’t do this  well you can  but people might stare   sex hair  check  fly isn’t down  check  having heart-to-hearts with your wing woman from the toilet  check  and it’s all priceless beauty comes from within 4 surprising times i feel most beautiful  does anyone else hear damian from “mean girls” singing “beautiful”   “don’t look at me…”  for most of my adolescence and well into my college years  i was collecting two things  compliments on my beauty and a sinking level of self-esteem  i would lie in bed  not understanding why the correlation fell short   i could stand in an evening gown and feel so exposed and tarnished by the anxiety   in the last two and a half decades  i’ve grown to understand there is a vast difference between looking beautiful and feeling beautiful  t  his realization has humbled me in ways i couldn’t have imaged and by things that cannot be found in the cosmetics aisle   once i started examining these differences  i concluded i feel most beautiful when i look my ugliest   when i have no makeup on   i don’t feel this way because i’m a natural beauty   i have the faint acne scarring and dimple-butt nose to prove i’m not    i feel beautiful when i don’t wear makeup because it means  for me anyway  i am secure enough to walk into my work and walmart alike barefaced   selfish  yes  a habit grown in college  i would prefer to sleep in for an extra 30 minutes or squeeze in another episode of “orange is the new black” than take the time to look acceptable for people who could never make me laugh as hard as taystee does   i guess i would rather be lazy and lethargic than polished and pretty   and  catering to that side of me — the very real side of me — makes me feel more honest  and  honesty is so goddamn beautiful   aside from being an inconsiderate slob  i love that the features i find most beautiful stand out when mountains of mascara and sculptured cheeks aren’t distracting people   when i do get dolled up  i usually collect the most compliments on my almond-shaped eyes that i rim with liquid eyeliner and glitter-mimicking eyeshadow   but  i think i have a stunning smile  which is likely my most underrated feature   lord knows i endured enough tortuous years of wearing braces and retainers to earn it    when i step out au naturel  my smile really stands out  and when it beams  i feel the most beautiful   after a good cry   it’s not because i’ve mastered the lauren conrad single-stream tear  in fact  my cry face is way uglier than kim kardashian’s   but  every time i wipe away that last tear  i feel as though i have shed layers of decaying  consuming and skin-sinking sadness   this is likely too extreme of a comparison  but a good cry is like a small-scale baptism  i feel most pure and most confident in the future after a cathartic release   in a hoodie and sweatpants   if i were a millionaire  i would totally zuckerberg it and wear my hoodie and “f ck you” flip-flops all day  every day   truthfully  i choose outdoor activities and movie-pizza options for dates because it provides the opportunity to wear sweats   i was not athletic in high school or college  and i have a fashion blog for christ’s sake   but i have a swagger i cannot replicate outside of sweatpants   i have dozens of photos of me looking like a mushroom or stuffed scarecrow in my dingy sweatpants  but i feel most “me” when i can drown in comfort   i love embracing my more masculine side because the corporate and dating world mostly conditions me to suppress it   when i can ask  and grant  forgiveness   it’s pretty much the basis of my entire christian religion  and i’m starting to see why   i’m stubborn as a bull   actually  i’m as stubborn as a ram  i’m an aries and am going to fault my stars for why i’m so resilient in my thoughts and fights    when i am fighting  screaming or trying to make someone feel small  i look ugly and feel disgusting   my words may be mighty and pack a punch  below the belt   but they are pushed by insecurity and unbending behavior   so  in the moments i ask for forgiveness and shine a light on my vulnerability  the ugliness begins to dissipate  asking forgiveness — and granting it — is a very beautiful experience for the soul   to consolidate this stream of consciousness  i feel most beautiful when i am being honest  vulnerable  masculine and human  which can unfortunately be seen as “ugly” in our world never give up 3 reasons resilience will always trump failure  if you would’ve told me i’d be where i’d be today at my college graduation  i would’ve given you that “you can’t be serious” face   i’m sure that by the age of 25  many of you envisioned yourselves at a certain point in your careers  probably making at least 50 to 60k  annually   living in a certain area with your so  outside of your parents’ home  and driving a pretty decent car  mine was a bmw    but  for many of us who reached this age  this is not our reality  and  if this is your reality  it sure as hell isn’t mine and i am not afraid to admit that   but  i do congratulate the few of you who managed to get your sh t together by this tender age   but  does this mean we’ll say “f ck it ” and throw in the towel  of course not   if anything  this ignites the light to our burning passion and desire that is embedded inside each and every one of us  life is a journey where the choices and decisions we make ultimately shape and influence our outcomes   the formula to life is actually very simple  what you put in  you get out  and if you don’t put in any effort at all  you’ll end up with nothing   i have always been somewhat of a free spirit  one of those creative  rebellious types who always  but unknowingly  goes against the grain   my erratic decisions  sometimes behavior  are embedded in my dna and people who think they have their entire lives planned out bore the hell out of me   although my disposition as an irrational individual manages to keep me somewhat sane  there came a point in time when my reality set in   i realized i could no longer walk away from corporate positions because i was bored and despised what i was doing   i could no longer wallow through life without implementing a plan for myself when i knew there were specific goals i needed to achieve   but  let’s not get it twisted  don’t think that with a plan  you will not encounter failure because you will  failure  as we all know is inevitable  unless you’re floyd mayweather in the ring   instead of focusing on and being afraid of failing  channel that energy into figuring out how you’ll bounce back when you do encounter failure   resilience is one hell of a trait to possess  and it’s always been one of my strong suits  whenever i’m faced with adversity  knowing i have to accomplish the goals i’ve created for myself keeps me driven   there is literally nothing in this world that can stop me or you from achieving whatever it is we set out to do   i also understand that embodying traits of resilience may be easier said than done  so here are three things you can start doing that will allow you to stop feeling sorry for what you haven’t done  yet   and start becoming the amazing individual you were created and destined to be   1  optimism isn’t easy  but it sure as hell beats being pessimistic   pessimists or “negative nancys ” as i like to call them  make me sick  they literally suck the life and passion out of people without even realizing it   they have a tainted perspective on life and their attitude reflects just that  stay away from these types of people  especially if you are someone who’s impressionable   your reality is not their reality  try surrounding yourself with “like-minded” people who share similar goals and perspectives as you  and if you can’t find either of these types of people  being alone never killed anyone   take some time away from your social life to truly assess your goals and gain a fresh perspective   2  running to criticism   “running to criticism” was one of the mantras of my previous corporate employers  and at that time  i truly believed it was the dumbest thing i ever heard   i couldn’t understand why anyone in his or right mind would willingly want to place him or herself in the uncomfortable position of being critiqued   it wasn’t until years later that i understood the power this saying possessed  anyone who is willing to become aware of his or her flaws is a winner   acknowledging  but not defending your flaws is a pivotal step on your road to resilience  everything you do will not always be right   in fact  you’re probably doing a lot of sh t wrong  which is why you’re reading this article   learn to embrace criticism  and you will begin to grow in ways you can’t even imagine   3  learn to adapt in every situation   lil’ kim once said  “i’m from brooklyn  i be everywhere comfortably ” there will be instances when you will be in uncompromising  very f cked up situations   we’ve all heard the famous saying  “never let ‘em see you sweat ” and that’s exactly what you have to learn to do   possessing a “fake it til you make it” mindset leads to developing overwhelming confidence  you’d be surprised how easy it can be   practice entering any and every situation like you’ve been there before  although you obviously haven’t   this will allow you to learn how to be flexible  and will subtly teach you how to overcome adversity   so  the next time you encounter failure  you’ll be able to adapt to changing circumstances without feeling defeated   and lastly  i hope that by this point it’s understood that you will not be able to become resilient if you have not implemented any goals for yourself   without having set goals in place  what are you really striving toward  the answer is nothing  and before you know it  you’ll be failing before you’ve even begun trying one mum s answer to the work-life balance conundrum combine business and pleasure  we are always hearing about the many areas of life that mums are expected to  balance    as well as work-life balance - which all too often involves returning home after a day at work and squeezing in a bedtime story  before tackling the household chores - in order to be truly  winning at life  we re also meant to find the energy for that all important  me  time to develop our personal interests   but what if instead of trying to balance all these competing demands for your time like some sort of compliant buckaroo  you found a way to combine them   that s exactly what mum-of-two  deborah todd  from manchester  has done   todd  39  has two children with her husband james - noah  seven  and zara  five   she combined her passion for exercise with a business plan and founded activewear brand  zaazee    i wanted to build something that my children would be proud of   todd told huffpost uk parents    i grew up in a sporty family and from an early age i loved taking part in pretty much every sport    but as you get older things change  life is much more demanding when you re a new mum and finding time to go to the gym or for a run is challenging    but when my two kids were born  i realised that i wanted to combine my love of sports and fitness with my career  so zaazee was born    fitnesswear was a complete departure for todd  as she had previously worked in pr and marketing – consulting for manchester city fc and the national football museum    although i never worked with any fashion brands - and i m terrible at sewing - i have always been passionate about well-made clothes and i’m learning fast about manufacturing  machinery  technical fabrics and all the amazing techniques that are out there   she said   she may not have had much experience of fashion  but todd is certain that her experience of raising two children meant she was well prepared to face the challenges of setting up a business    mums are very flexible and we are used to putting the hours in   she says    plus  mums are generally very well organised – we are used to having lots of things to juggle and keeping all the balls in the air  so to speak    mums are also extremely robust  we have to be    work can be a release after being with kids all day  so mums tend to be very dedicated as working can help with self-esteem   todd adds    it’s not always about the money  it s more about the reward that doing something you enjoy gives you    mums are pretty awesome    todd also tapped into her own insights when designing her activewear range and this is what she feels make zaazee stand out from other brands    the zaazee range includes features gleaned from my own experience and research  such as high waistbands on the capris and no sewn-in labels on anything for maximum comfort   she says    zaazee is designed and made by women for women  and our fit and quality of fabric is pretty unique    we use incredible technical fabrics such as supplex  which is stretchy and robust  with minimal pilling  none of those bobbly bits we are so used to    it feels luxurious but it works really hard    todd s children made her think carefully about her position as an employer  she knew first hand the unique difficulties of being a working parent    it was hard to work around the children when i first started up  as having your own business can be very labour-intensive   she says    i worked when they were asleep and before they would get up in the morning  i didn’t want to miss them in any school or nursery performances  so i worked silly hours to make sure i was always there for them - and i still do    time is a major challenge  when your kids want dinner  or if they need to be somewhere  that comes first    as a mother  todd felt very aware of the conditions of the mothers who worked in the portuguese factory where her garments are made    our seamstresses are women who have been working in the trade for years and they are a strong team who work around having kids and making sure they are good mums   she says    given the economic climate in portugal some of the women are the main bread winners  so we feel good to be helping them out too    at home  i don t have any direct zaazee employees - yet   she adds    my husband james who is an ace developer looks after our website  my fabulous brother and my sister grace help out with social media and i use a freelance pr consultant and copywriter as well as consultants and people i’ve worked with for years for my clients  most work hours to suit them    we want to grow and need to be flexible  most of the team have other jobs and kids  and we we work around their hours    todd was inspired to start her business by the birth of her children and now she is enjoying seeing her children becoming inspired by their mother s hard work    now we are up and running  the kids are really into zaazee   she says    they love to help out whether it’s handing out flyers by our stand at events or helping to sort through boxes of stock at home    i think it’s great and they are learning fast about business and commerce    todd s advice for parents planning to set up their own business  be prepared to put in long hours – really long  be prepared for more guilt  but know you are working hard towards something special  accept that you can’t do everything and ask for help where possible  i used to do all the kids  after school activity runs  but i just can’t do them all the time now and i know i have to make sacrifices  know your limits and remember that creating a business doesn’t happen overnight  i keep telling myself this   you don t need to be perfect - i have to wing making dinner most days and i sometimes put the most random meals together  i’m constantly running out of milk and the house has so much ironing this couple is traveling the world to find the perfect wedding destination  in 2011  alex pelling and lisa gant sold all of their belongings and left their home in manchester  england  they embarked on a four-year  and counting  journey around the world with plans to hold wedding ceremonies along the way    we wanted to meet local people  experience local culture and understand what makes the world tick   gant said   we are crazy romantics and to give us some purpose  we decided to look for somewhere to get married  in each place     so far  pelling and gant have tied the knot 70 times in roughly 70 different countries  including argentina  morocco  austria  south africa and jordan  none of the ceremonies thus far have been legally binding  at the end of their trip  they still have 10 to 15 more countries to visit   they will return to one of the locations with their friends and family and make the marriage official    after two years on the road -- our initial plan -- and 48 weddings  we realized that life is all about the journey  not the destination   gant told the huffington post   we learned that our adventure is all about the people  making new friends and being made welcome into homes  lives and even the most sacred traditions    the couple live in a camper van to cut down on travel and lodging costs  their biggest expenses  fuel  car repairs and visas  they say  many of the wedding photographers and other vendors they ve used charge them little or nothing for their services  in exchange  gant and pelling recommend their businesses and write about them on their blog 2people1life com  where they document their adventures    what is amazing to learn is that every culture celebrates the union of two people   gant told huffpost   making a commitment to one another is cause for celebration  sometimes a week or more of celebrations in some cultures  it is such an important part of everyone’s lives  literally every person on the planet  even if  they re  not the ones getting married  whole communities come together to wish the couple well and rejoice with them    below  check out more incredible photos from the couple s journey how getting rid of this one item changed my life  all illustrated by anna sudit   something good is happening lately -- i feel fitter  happier  and in control  my clothes seem to fit better than they used to and i m more energized and confident  no  it s not the latest fad diet  i haven t changed a thing about my workout routine  here s the thing  i no longer own a full-length mirror   mirrors weren t always a problem for me  when i was young  i hardly gave my reflection a second thought  i was a skinny kid -- the little girl with a voracious appetite and endless energy  as a teen  i could eat what i pleased  a cheesy buffalo chicken calzone  big helpings of my mom s unbeatable spaghetti  sandwiches piled high with cold cuts  even with college nights of heavy drinking and the late-night eats that went with them  i only gained a few auxiliary pounds  in fact  i loved food so much that i made it my job after graduation when i became an assistant editor at a national food publication in new york city   new york  a job  i was an adult  and  just like that  my pizza party was over   i started gaining weight -- fast  pants ripped unceremoniously  sweaters grew tight in the shoulders  cellulite showed up in places i never knew it could  arms  really     my identity as the skinny girl who could hold her own at 25-cent wings night  was shaken  my metabolism had come to a screeching halt  for the first time  i felt the need to watch what i ate  but  the  eat what i want  when i want it  mentality was nearly indelible after a lifetime of being able to do exactly that   i knew i d gained weight  but i didn t want to let it change my life  i conducted business as usual  dinner or drinks with friends five nights a week  with guilt-erasing healthy lunches  and a workout here and there   but the one thing that ate me alive was seeing my new body in my full-length mirror   i d always been an indecisive dresser  but now it was out of control  mornings began with me ripping through my drawers and closet for multiple outfit changes and painstaking tweaks  if a pair of jeans made my legs look too thick or a shirt didn t fall perfectly  i d nix them -- even if  to everyone else  i looked great  the dressing panic became a habit  i was consistently running late for work  missing big chunks of movies  and -- in one extreme circumstance -- losing a reservation at a restaurant because i spent so long deliberating over a dress 11 types of mum you meet at baby group  mummy friends  mummy enemies  the mummy we love to hate   you find all sorts lurking in baby groups  doing the circuits   having held the title  mummy  for just over two and a half years i have been around the block with the baby groups and coffee mornings   probably even more so given the

mummy related   before you know it they become a true friend  one you laugh with  cry with  drink with  eat too much cake with  wipe baby poo off all conceivable surfaces with   once you find this one make sure not to let them go   to all my mummy friends i m sorry if i ve used you on the blog or relayed any stories above      you know who you are and you know i wouldn t be without you 13 things that happen when you ve got a big bum  there are two types of women in this world  those with small bums and those with massive bums   i  proudly  fall into the latter group    women with big bums have recently become something of a spectacle  with many becoming famous for their ass-ets  excuse the pun  above all else  the term belfie spilled on to our social media feeds in 2013 and we haven t looked back since   but big bums are nothing new and neither is the adoration for them  i ve had one for as long as i can remember and am a descendent of a long line of big-bummed women   you think my bum is big  you wait  til you see my mum      so without further ado  here are 13 things all big-bummed women know to be true   you own the dance floor whenever a bum song comes on  sir mix-a-lot wrote that one for me  ok   just don t automatically assume we can all twerk   cause it s a lot harder than it looks  when you wear anything remotely tight everyone thinks you re going on a date  but really you re just going to the shop to get hummus     and everyone knows when you ve got a vpl  because your pl is so much bigger than everyone else s  for that reason  squats are your friend     your slightly annoying  often painful friend   but so  of course  is cake     because thigh gaps are over-rated  that s why you constantly knock things off of tables as you try to squeeze past  that bum just doesn t fit through small gaps  alright      and why trying to find clothes that fit is nigh-on impossible  you spend your life jumping around your bedroom trying to squeeze into skinny jeans  but on the plus side  imagine walking around with a built-in cushion to sit on  it s pretty damn cool  of course  you haven t always loved your big bum     you used to hate it and want to be skinny  but now you re its number one fan     high-fives body confidence   you have maturity and your fellow big-bummed women to thank for that  beyonce is your spirit animal  but you still lose your shit whenever someone says  big bums are in fashion   i mean it s not like you ever had a choice in the matter   kindhearted strangers cheer up three-year-old who  couldn t be princess elsa because she s black   when rachel muir took her three-year-old daughter to the shops dressed as princess elsa  she never could ve imagined that the day would turn so sour   but muir was left raging after her daughter was subjected to racism by another mother and her two daughters at a disney-themed event   while she waited patiently in line for the children s snow pit at their local centre in melbourne  three-year-old samara was told by the woman in front that she shouldn t be dressed up because  queen elsa isn t black    then  one of her daughters reportedly screwed up her face and said   you re black and black is ugly    little samara was left in floods of tears by the horrible comments and  in the days following the incident  she became increasingly withdrawn   her mother  rachel muir told the courier that her daughter even refused to go to her aboriginal dance class   when she asked her three-year-old why she didn t want to go  samara pointed at the skin on her arm and asked why she was black   left upset by how much the ordeal had affected her daughter  muir took to facebook to rant about the racism that she d encountered at her local shopping centre   but  as word spread of samara s story  something rather beautiful happened - not only did she receive hundreds of messages of support from fans across the globe  but samara has also been crowned a  queen    she has since been given tickets to see - and perform in - the disney on ice show  and has been inundated with disney-themed gifts   meanwhile  indigenous rapper  adam briggs   has invited samara to star in his new music video    we are very overwhelmed and shocked by the kindness of people   i didn t think people would care so much   samara s mum told the courier    i can t express how much it has meant to us  to know that she has touched so many people … that they see her how i see her  is just incredible    she is back to her proud  beautiful aboriginal self  morbidly obese couple save £10k for his  n  hers gastric bands so  nhs doesn t foot the bill   an obese couple with a combined weight of almost 42 stone  600lbs  have pledged to spend their life savings on matching gastric bands in order to save the nhs money   chris and isabella wray said that they are the only ones responsible for their weight gain and  as a result  don t want the taxpayer to pay for the weight loss surgery   isabella  31  weighs 19-and-a-half stone while chris  aged 41  tips the scales at 21-and-a-half stone   the couple  who have five children between them  will both go under the knife next month at a private hospital near their home in edgbaston  birmingham   the weight-reducing ops will cost them £5 000 each privately but they have both vowed to foot the bill themselves   isabella  an accounts administrator  said that she had struggled with her weight throughout most of her adult life and found it even more difficult to lose weight after each pregnancy    chris had always been a yo-yo dieter and he was slim when i met him  but we bonded over our love of food   she revealed    when we started dating he would take me to michelin-star restaurants  and we loved browsing food festivals and street food markets together    chris  a software engineer who has been with isabella for three years  has a 44  waist and wears xxxl shirts   his bmi is a life-threatening 40 which  he said  is the result of eating two breakfasts every single day    we got ourselves into this situation by greed  so it s up to us to find a way out of it   said chris   to put it plainly  we love food - and we don t expect the nhs to pick up bill for it    isabella  who is a size 22  said   it s wrong that dole-claiming scroungers who have never worked a day in their life get the surgery for free    we are not super-rich  we are a working family and instead of buying a new car  we are going to buy ourselves a new lifestyle    you can t put a price on your health    chris revealed   our favourite foods were share-sized packets of crisps and calorific homemade desserts  like crumble with custard    because we have kids to feed  isabella would make gigantic portions - then she and i would return for second or third helpings  just because the food was there    we would eat dinner early in the evening but by 8pm we would be peckish again  and would end up having a second dinner in front of the telly like three rounds of toast with popcorn    he added   we knew it was unhealthy  but the truth is  we loved eating and would get through tonnes and tonnes of food every week    isabella s daily diet   breakfast  nothing  lunch  jacket potato with a tin of tuna  salad and a tub of coleslaw  afternoon snack  sharing size packet of crisps  dinner  two helpings of moussaka with extra cheddar cheese and bacon  followed by two helpings of apple crumble with custard   evening snacks  three rounds of toast and a bowl of popcorn   drinks  diet fizzy drink chris  daily diet   4am breakfast  large bowl of cereal with full-fat milk  8am breakfast at work  full english breakfast  lunch  fish and chips  afternoon snacks  onion bhajis and samosas  dinner  two helpings of moussaka with extra cheddar cheese and bacon  followed by two helpings of apple crumble with custard   evening snacks  three rounds of toast and a bowl of popcorn   drinks  diet fizzy drink with bmis over 40  both isabella and chris were classed as morbidly obese and told repeatedly by their gp that they were eligible for gastric band surgery on the nhs    we were offered the nhs health programme as we d both had health issues relating to weight   said isabella   if we failed the programme  we would be entitled to a free gastric band    we politely refused    instead  the couple discussed forking out for a gastric band with their own savings and arranged a consultation   but chris decided he didn t want to resort to the dramatic treatment without trying to diet    we spent the next three months trying to lose weight naturally  we worked out  ate healthily and even tried slimming pills   he said    i lost a stone and isabella lost two  but we couldn t keep the weight off  slowly  we piled on the pounds again and undid all our hard work    in april this year  we accepted that eating huge portions was making us fat  isabella suggested that we go through with getting a gastric band fitted    she was joking - but slowly we realised that this was the only solution for us - because we love eating    chris and isabella wray before they gained weight  chris added   we knew it was a life-changing decision  and we knew it would be expensive  but never for one second did we consider approaching the nhs    as a couple  we pride ourselves on being independent  and we are not willing to accept services for free when we can pay our own way    besides  we are both mobile and able to work - so there s no reason to try and scrounge the treatment    during a consultation at dolan park  part of birmingham hospital group  earlier this month  the couple were told they can have the 20-minute keyhole surgery on the same day and are even able to share a room   isabella added   for a family with five kids  10k is a huge amount to spend  but we think it s only right that we spend our own money    asking for tight nhs budgets to spent correcting our greed would be an insult to the taxpayer    chris hopes to lose 6st by christmas  and isabella expects to lose 4st   isabella added that they ve been warned there could be complications  but they re willing to go ahead with it anyway    it s a life-changing operation and funding it with our own money has forced us to think seriously about doing it   she said   this has not been an easy decision    but we are essentially buying a new lifestyle  so it s worth it  mum supports 9-year-old transgender child s decision to transition at the start of the school year  a nine-year-old child who was born a boy  has been praised for his  bravery  by his mother  after making the decision to start the next school year as a girl   joseph hughes  from rhyl  north wales  asked for a wig for christmas and wears a dress when out with mum sam hughes  41  as he makes the transition to becoming ellie-jo   his mum said   he is definitely more confident as ellie-jo and more content in himself    i just wanted to raise awareness because i had no idea about this until joseph started acting more like a girl when he was two    i want to help other families feel as secure and comfortable with it as i am    the proud mum-of-six said she leaves it up to joseph to decide his gender   hughes said   joseph is the one who has made this choice - if i d have dressed him up as a girl from the start then he wouldn t have had a clue - but all this has come from him and i just let him get on with it    some days he ll come home from school and put a dress on  some days it ll be some a t-shirt and jeans    it s easier for him to dress up and paint his nails when he s indoors at the moment because he can still get a little embarrassed when someone notices his nails    hughes added   he s started going out in a dress when he is with me so that ll prepare him for when he has to go out on his own and do it - he wants to back to school as a girl in september    the full-time mum says she is sure it is not a phase after taking joseph to see specialists at camhs  child and adult mental health services  and a children s clinic in rhuddlan  north wales   the specialists said they want to wait until joseph s hormones develop by the time he is 11 to see if it is a lasting choice   but hughes has no doubt in her mind that joseph has gender dysphoria   hughes said   what child at the age of nine chooses to go outside dressed as a girl  as an adult that would not be normal - i wouldn t do that - that s bravery    he s my son and i will back him all the way whatever he wants to do    if he turns around in five years  time and says i want to be a boy or i want to make the change permanent then i will never stand in his way  pensioner who donated his late wife s wedding dress to charity is  overwhelmed  that it sold for almost £3 000  a pensioner who donated his late wife s wedding dress to a charity shop has said he feels  proud and elated  that it sold for almost £3 000   the dress was left at st gemma s hospice charity shop in garforth with a touching note two weeks ago  which read   i wish any lady who takes this dress to have a life with her loved one 56 years like i did  happy years    i was a lucky man to marry a lady like mine    the charity shop wrote about the dress on their social media accounts and after it gained global attention  they decided to put it up for auction on ebay to allow more people to bid for it   according to a recent update on their facebook page  the dress has now sold for £2 910   staff at st gemma s hospice charity shop managed to track down the  true gent  who donated the dress thanks to the help of social media  but the man wishes to remain anonymous   however  the charity s head of communications nicola woodgate met with the 85-year-old    he s absolutely thrilled with the reaction and is overwhelmed that his special donation received global acclaim  he cannot believe the media frenzy and is overwhelmed with the amount raised for the dress on ebay   she told the mailonline    he is so happy and proud that the hospice will benefit from funds raised by the auction of the dress  he wishes to remain anonymous and we fully respect his decision but he is watching the media frenzy with interest and thinks it is wonderful    we have thanked him so much for his kindness and he would like to thank everyone for their support    women share their menstruation woes with  livetweetyourperiod  hilarity ensues  cramps  gas  acne or the most vicious kind of hunger  yep  when aunt flo comes to visit  it can be the worst thing ever   just search for the hashtag  livetweetyourperiod for proof  women of the interwebs have been employing the hashtag to share their menstruation-related woes   from “carrie”-like bloodiness to insatiable junk food cravings  the posts run the gamut    livetweetyourperiod has been around for several months  there are tweets dating back to november   but found a new audience this week after being written about in the new york times magazine   writer jenna wortham wrote that the hashtag could help “normalize  desexualize and destigmatize women’s reproductive health ”  “on the surface   the hashtag  seems like little more than communal commiseration  but to me  it felt like something bigger  a microprotest against a modern paradox  social media is saturated with images of hypersexualized women  but these are rarely considered as scandalous as content that dares to reveal how a woman’s body actually functions ” she wrote   many twitter users appear to agree   according to the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists  two out of three women are estimated to experience some pain during their period  while  as many as 85 percent of menstruating women  experience one or more symptoms of premenstrual syndrome  which include depression  irritability  anxiety  bloating  fatigue and abdominal pain 6 ways that your personality type affects your sleep  are you an early bird  perfectionist  extrovert  your  personality type  may explain a lot about how you interact with the world when you re awake  but it may also give a bit of insight into your sleep habits   while character traits are hardly a significant or deciding factor when it comes to our sleeping patterns  it turns out how we behave can still subtly affect us while we sleep  below are a few ways our personality  sleep schedules and shut-eye might be linked   1  genetics determine whether you re a night owl or an early bird  you may not even be able to help it if you prefer to rise with the sun or the stars  the distinction between late nighters and early risers -- also known as a chronotype -- may lie in our body s own internal clock  chronotypes are largely determined by genetics  the bbc reported    chronotypes reflect individual differences in the timing of the circadian rhythm and can be affected by age   natalie dautovich  an environmental scholar at the national sleep foundation  told the huffington post in an email   for example  adolescents are more likely to be an evening type compared to older adults    2  early birds may be happier  early birds get the worm  and it turns out they also might get a few health perks  too  morning people report feeling happier and tend to be more persistent than their night-owl counterparts   research also suggests morning people may be more well-rested since they are less likely to experience  social jet lag   which is what happens when our biological clock is out of sync with our 9-to-5 social clock   3   type as  might struggle with falling asleep  if you re a notorious overthinker  like a type a individual  you might have a little trouble letting go of your stressors -- especially when you crawl into bed   cognitive arousal can take many forms  from simply reviewing the activities of the day  to ruminating or worrying about different things   dautovich said   for some people  that inability to shut off the brain may prevent them from falling asleep  says dr  shalini paruthi  education committee chair of the american academy of sleep medicine and the director of the pediatric sleep and research center at saint louis university    what it really means is that the mind isn t mentally aligning with the body to physically fall asleep   paruthi told the huffington post  if anxious thoughts are keeping you awake  there are therapies to help treat the problem -- the most common form being cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia  she said   4  night owls are believed to be greater risk-takers  evening people may be more sensation- or novelty-seeking  according to a 2014 study published in the journal personality and individual differences  they re rumored to be more creative and have higher cognitive abilities  though paruthi explains that research has yet to confirm that as far as she knows   night owls get a bad rap for burning the midnight oil  but their late bedtime isn t something to criticize as long they re getting the recommended seven hours of interrupted sleep each night  paruthi said   5  extroverts might get a better quality of sleep  in a preliminary 2014 study published in the journal health psychology  researchers found an association between individuals with higher extroversion and better sleep  the same association was found in individuals with high conscientiousness and agreeableness  this of course is not the sole indicator of a good night s rest  as other environmental factors play a much bigger role  but studying the link between personality and sleep  may benefit more personalized treatment of sleep disorders and help in personnel selection to jobs in which it is critical to stay alert   the researchers noted   6  neurotic individuals may be more susceptible to insomnia  those who display traits of neuroticism may have an increased stress-reactivity  which could lead to sleep disruption and insomnia  according to 2013 findings published in the journal sleep medicine reviews  however  researchers note that neuroticism and stress are somewhat cyclical  so it s likely the anxiety that s associated with the behavior is what could be leading to poor sleep    stress can definitely be a detriment to obtaining healthy sleep   dautovich said   stress can create a vicious cycle where it affects sleep  and the lack of sleep affects our ability to cope with stress    what can we do about it  ultimately  experts stress that personality types have little influence compared to other external factors in your sleep environment  so don t worry too much if you identify with a certain behavioral trait  regardless of what s keeping you up at night  whether it be your wired mind or something else  here are a few tips to help you fall asleep faster and get a better quality of sleep   get out of bed  if you don t  your brain may start associating that sleep haven with being wide awake  if you don t fall asleep within 20 to 30 minutes  get up and go to a different room  check the temperature  the best quality of sleep is achieved in a cool  dark room  the ideal temperature for getting quality shuteye is around 60 to 68 degrees  dautovich previously told huffpost  try an activity  just make sure it s boring  paruthi advised  pick up a dull textbook if you can t seem to drift off  sorry  no harry potter   writing in a journal may also help  ban those screens  turn off those devices at least 30 minutes  but preferably an hour  before bed  paruthi said  research shows that the blue wavelengths emitted from screens may delay the production of melatonin  the hormone in the body that helps us drift off   use a  physical  alarm clock to wake up in the morning   she said  stick to a sleep routine  start getting ready for bed around the same time and make it a calming ritual  meditation  anyone     people fail to prioritize sleep   paruthi said   a routine really helps guide the brain -- and sleep is a function of the brain -- that s time to switch from

women into engineering is vital  the uk faces a deficit of 340 000 engineers by 2020  only 6  of britain s engineers are female  china produces 20-times more engineers than the uk every year  and one in three of them are women   at school and university women outperform men in science  technology  engineering and mathematics  indeed  the few who do become engineers enjoy it - 98  of women engineers find their job rewarding  who wouldn t   it is therefore incomprehensible that 93  of parents would not support their daughters in pursuing a career in engineering  actually it s not that surprising  my parents  classicists  were not engineering advocates  nor was my careers advisor at school who having taken one look at me  and noting my enjoyment of the outdoors  suggested i become an estate agent  he could not have been more wrong - and thank god i didn t listen to him   we need to change young people s assumption of what an engineer is  or more accurately  their parents  assumptions  and excite them about the prospects  it is fulfilling and frustrating  in equal measure  and you can be confident your skills will always be in demand   inspiring teachers and an inspiring curriculum are the catalyst to creating more engineers  design and technology lessons put mathematics and physics to practical use  done well  it provides a window into the real world of engineering  not oily rags and spanners  but a job in which you see the world s problems - and solve them  unfortunately  so often d t is viewed as the second best    but it is the food of future engineers   my charity  the james dyson foundation  works with five schools in bath - we are reengineering d t curriculum and getting industry grade equipment into the labs  no more key fobs and bookends - instead  students work in teams to prototype inventions which answer a brief  then iteratively test and redesign   it is real life engineering - a curriculum designed by real-world engineers  it shows what engineering is really like and the children are hooked  d t teachers say the subject is more respected than ever  and engineers are seen as heroes   150  more girls are choosing d t at gcse as a result  include the boys  and we have doubled the potential number of engineers in the making  food for thought as the government redesigns the d t gcse curriculum  make it relevant and engaging - a perfect pipeline for future engineers   changing perceptions and making it inspiring is a start  but there are other barriers to girls becoming engineers  at a-level only 20  of those studying physics were girls  versus 55  in biology and 50  for chemistry  this is a problem  studying engineering at university requires physics  remove this barrier and the applications flow   the new dyson school of design engineering at imperial college london has attracted a cohort of 42  females for its four year course  by waiving the requirement for an a-level in physics and introducing a hefty focus on design  that is three times the national average - university college london is doing a similar thing and achieving a similar result  the physics still has to be learned  but learning by doing is the best way  they will be better engineers for it - and more importantly they have the opportunities to be engineers in the first place   ultimately we need more engineers  male or female  but getting women into engineering is vital  it will not just alleviate the shortage  but could actually improve the engineering solutions that are developed  rather than bemoaning the lack of engineers  let s celebrate our female role models and excite our children about the possibilities of a career in engineering  britain s high technology companies need their brain power introducing camel no  the underwear that will banish your camel toe using  medical grade silicone   just when we thought beauty standards for women couldn t get any more ridiculous  a new product has been launched to banish camel toes   that s right ladies  your natural nether regions are now deemed to be too unsightly for human eyes   but don t worry  you can buy a special pair of knickers to give you a barbie-smooth vagina in no time   they go by the name of camel no   created by maggie han for her underwear brand seamless thread  the knickers feature a silicone liner made of a polyester and spandex blend    women don’t want to address their camel toes and think if you have a camel toe then you must have a huge vagina and that’s not it   han told mashable   she went on to say that the underwear is made out of  medical grade silicone  - the same material that is used for breast enhancements   she explained   it also takes the temperature of your body  when you sweat it won t create a smell    han insists she designed the product to empower women and motivate them  to wear everything in their closet and not have to fidget and fuss over it and be self-conscious    camel no isn t the first product created to get rid of camel toes  last year the cuchini was revealed to be the product of choice among beauty pageant contestants competing in swimsuit rounds   the sanitary towel-like product is designed to be stuck to the inside of knickers or swimsuits to give the wearer a smooth pubic area   thanks for your concern everyone  but we ll leave our camel toes as they are

strangers into their home  a vlogger who conducts social experiments about children s safety has demonstrated that many children need refresher course on  stranger danger  after successfully getting kids to let him into their house   joey salads previously completed a social experiment where he managed to get children to follow him out of the park  simply by sparking up a conversation about his cute dog   however this time  salads trialled  home invasion  and has shocked parents after managing to get children - who had never met him before - to let him into their houses   before conducting the experiment  salads contacted the parents for permission to set up a camera and they agree to pretend to be in the shower when he arrives   for each child filmed  salads knocks on the door and asks   is your mum home    the children all say yes and explain that she s in the shower   he then says   i m your mum s friend is it okay if i just come in and wait for her    at that point  every single child agrees and invites the stranger into their house   as soon as salads is let in  he calls down the mum and then explains to the child that he has just been let in the house as a complete stranger   when prompted as to why they let salads in one child says   because he said he was your friend    another mother was angry at her children for even answering the door  after they were told not to if they weren t expecting anyone   salads says he wants to highlight the importance of teaching your children about strangers and making sure they really understand what the term  stranger  means powerful photos show teen girl overcoming idiopathic scoliosis  after having to wear back brace for 23 hours per day and major surgery  hannah was just nine years old when she started wearing a back brace everyday   she d developed severe idiopathic scoliosis  which is curvature of the spine  and was required to wear the brace for up to 23 hours a day   by the time she hit her teenage years  she was told she d have to undergo major surgery that fused her spine with two titanium rods to help her stand up straight   now  the brave teen has decided to share her story  in an attempt to raise awareness of a debilitating condition   hannah s journey - from the days where she had to wear a back brace to now  where she is hitting puberty - has been documented by julia cybularz  her aunt and talented photographer  as part of the breaking the girl series   julia also happens to have scoliosis and  although she hadn t had to have such drastic treatment  understands some of the struggles that hannah is going through    i was inspired by hannah  my niece’s courage  to complete this body of work  i shared a similar experience with scoliosis when i was hannah’s age however i did not go through the bracing or surgery   cybularz told huffpost uk lifestyle    it is my hope that the photographs create a dialogue and encourage people to learn more about scoliosis     breaking the girl explores the physical manifestations of anxiety  hope and the pervasive sentiment that occurs when a body inhabits a space that is not quite one s own   julia wrote on her website ryan reynolds has been criticised on instagram for how he is carrying his baby in father s day photo  just like many other celebrity dads on father s day  ryan reynolds was pictured in a sweet instagram photo with his six-month-old daughter  james   however  since the photo has been uploaded  fans have piped up saying he is carrying his baby incorrectly  in a position that could potentially harm the child   comments began trickling in after the photo  posted by his wife  blake lively  received more than 332 000 likes  stating that the infant s feet sticking out was not good for her   although some fans didn t pay attention to how he was carrying his baby  and focused more on how  adorable you both look    others were quick to urge reynolds to find out how to do it properly   one person said   please find out how you re supposed to wear the baby in that carrier  she will fall out    while others added reasoning to why reynolds was holding her wrong   comments included   the way the babies legs are positioned is not ergonomic and hard on her hips     why are her feet hanging out the bottom     that can be the weirdest and dangerous way to wear your baby  please learn the proper way to do it  baby s legs should be in frog position       you shouldn t carry your baby like that    it s bad for their hips       her head should be supported  and her feet shouldn t be hanging  sort it out    the concern comes from the baby having her legs  which could lead to hip dysplasia   hipdysplasia org states that the condition is hard to detect because it does not cause pain in babies and doesn’t

by those concerned with hip dysplasia which is the dislocation of hips  they babies are carried in the  m  position    this is where they have their bottom down and their knees up    carrying a baby close to you is a good idea when they are small because they settle more easily  so we would praise him for that    but the concern is that it is just more comfortable and better for the baby to use the  m  position    dodd said some babies are more prone than others to hip dysplasia  and some babies are even born with their hip not correctly set in their socket   reynolds correctly carries the baby front-facing  on nct s safety recommendations about carrying a baby it states   carrying a young baby facing out in a sling is not recommended  as it forces your baby’s back straight against your chest  and causes their legs to dangle in a harness like position    this can mean the baby’s weight rests on his crotch rather than being spread from his bottom and thighs  seven-year-old boy saves his mum and baby brother from armed robbers  a brave seven-year-old has become west midland police s  youngest hero  after he stood up to armed robbers who came into his home and  terrorised  his mum and baby brother   muhammed ali  from birmingham  faced seven raiders who broke into his home in october 2014 and demanded his mother give them her gold jewellery   the seven-year-old has now been presented with a young person s award for his bravery by the west midland s police   chief insp phil radbourne said went presenting the award   it must have been scary but muhammed s first instinct was to run towards the men and to protect his mum - his actions were extremely brave and undoubtedly left the burglars stunned    muhammed was in his bed when the incident happened on 2 october 2014   hearing a noise he went downstairs to see what was happening  he saw his mother surrounded by seven masked men  with one of them holding his baby brother   the boy shouted at the men to leave his mum alone and detectives believe this threw the attackers  who moments later left the house   chief radbourne added   muhammed  his mum and his baby brother all escaped unhurt  though they were understandably very shaken by the ordeal    i m delighted we ve recognised muhammed s bravery with a chief constable s young persons award    he can be rightly proud of himself    a similar story surfaced earlier this year  when a five-year-old girl called 999 after her mother had an epileptic fit   elleemae addison  from warrington  was also with her three-month-old sister at the time  she followed advice her mum had previously given her and managed to call 999   on the recorded phone call she said   my mum had a fit   alerting paramedics to the problem and helping to save her mum skinny jeans health warning issued after woman left with nerve damage  skinny jeans are something of a fashion go-to for both men and women   but now  experts have issued a health warning for the jeans because they can severely damage muscles and nerves   this comes after a woman was left hospitalised because she d been crouched down in skinny jeans for a long period of time   the warning was issued in the journal of neurology  neurosurgery and psychiatry after a 35-year-old woman developed compartment syndrome   according to the nhs  it is a painful and potentially serious condition caused by bleeding or swelling within an enclosed bundle of muscles   the journal said the australian woman had to be cut out of her skinny jeans after she d spent the day squatting and emptying cupboards to help her friend move house   as the day progressed  her calves swelled severely  her feet became extremely numb and she found it increasingly difficult to walk   doctors at royal adelaide hospital have since concluded that the condition was made far worse by her skinny jeans   neurologist dr thomas kimber told ctvnews ca   as the calf muscles swelled  they compressed the two main nerves of the lower legs  the peroneal nerve and the tibial nerve  which supply sensation to the ankles and the feet    he added that the muscles in her legs began to break down and release proteins into the blood  a process which is called rhabdomyolysis   according to dr kimber  these proteins can potentially cause kidney damage   the woman was put on an intravenous drip to flush the proteins out and  despite damage to her lower leg muscles and nerves  she was able to walk again unaided after four days   dr kimber issued some handy advice to stop this from happening to others    if you re going to wear skinny jeans  don t go do a job that involves prolonged squatting   he said    and if you wear these jeans and get numbness and tingling  you should definitely get up and walk around to get the blood moving to prevent this from happening to you    this isn t the first study to suggest that skinny jeans are a health issue  either   in 2012  the international business times reported that a microsurgeon had suggested skinny jeans could be responsible for a painful disorder called meralgia paresthetica   the condition is characterised by tingling  numbness and burning pain in your outer thigh   according to mayo clinic  it s caused by compression of the nerve that supplies sensation to the skin surface of your thigh teen with ehlers danlos syndrome  condition where joints dislocate every day  seeks life-changing treatment  a teenager who can t eat properly and spends most of the time on oxygen because her joints constantly dislocate has revealed how she needs to raise £500 000 to seek specialist treatment abroad   emily james  17  suffers from a health condition called ehlers danlos syndrome which means that her joints dislocate extremely easily - this applies to her shoulders  knees  wrists  fingers  elbows  hips and even her jaw   now  her illness has become so bad that she sleeps in casts to keep her joints together and visits a e up to two times a day   according to the nhs  ehlers danlos syndrome is a collection of inherited conditions that fit into a larger group  known as heritable disorders of connective tissue   this tissue provides support in skin  tendons  ligaments  blood vessels  internal organs and bones   in james  case  this has resulted in the increased range of movement of joints  which is often caused by faulty collagen   since her diagnosis  the condition has resulted in a string of horrendous health experiences including 17 counts of pneumonia and having to be fed through a tube in her stomach   the severity of her condition first came to light three years ago when james was rushed to hospital after her jaw dislocated   she was sent into surgery to have part of the bone taken from her hip and put into her jaw  however this only prevented the problem from happening for as little as three months    i had to go back to theatre to have my bone graft reversed  which was extremely upsetting   she reveals in an open letter on her go fund me page   but things eventually worsened to the point where she went into theatre in 2013 as a day case  and remained an inpatient for the rest of the year    i ended up with lots of worrying problems   revealed james  who is from salford  greater manchester    my swallowing had become a big problem and wasn t safe because my muscles had become floppy  so it was unsafe for me to eat and drink safely    i struggled with my chest for months  i was given so many antibiotics that i ve become immune to them    in october 2013  things took a turn for the worse    one sunday night things changed and all of a sudden i was unable to breathe properly    my mum was beside herself  there were so many doctors  i was scared  my voice box had gone into spasms  it couldn t work properly anymore as the muscles in my vocal cords had become weak    her mother  karen james  was told to call emily s father and other members of the family as the doctors didn t know if they could save her    that was the most heartbreaking time of my family s life   said james   that night we will never forget    sadly  the teen is still having problems with her health - in fact  things are gradually getting worse    i ve been in hospital again for almost six months with problems with my jaw   she said   but this time the consultants are saying they can do no more for me    now  james  family are hoping to raise £500 000 to send her to the us where she can see a specialist consultant   james  mother  karen  told the daily mail that her daughter s condition is so bad that she now has to regularly put her joints back in place    however they are all such a mess now and so distorted that i can t see where they are supposed to go and i have to do it by emily saying when they are right   she explained   james  joints don t even stay in place on their own anymore  which means sometimes they have to take her to a e twice a day   her mum added that doctors are going to make a full body cast for james to sleep in so that her joints are held together  as otherwise  she can t make it through the night     i have heard emily beg for the pain to stop it can be that bad  her life shouldn t be every day in hospital  if someone who knows anything about it can just suggest something that we could try  it could change our lives    visit emily s go fund me page to donate

condition causes the body to age prematurely and the current average life expectancy for someone with progeria is 13 years old   so needless to say  pondare s birthday was certainly worth celebrating  the young woman had a princess-themed party complete with was ball gown and thrown to mark the momentous occasion    progeria is a condition diagnosed in children whose bodies are not able to produce a properly functioning version of a protein called “lamin a”  which is involved in important functions such as dna repair   the nhs explains    instead  their bodies make a defective version of the protein  known as progerin  which triggers a range of adverse effects at the cellular level  this causes major damage to multiple parts of the body  mimicking advanced ageing    surgeon dr pierre r

video on asperger s syndrome  which offers a fascinating insight into what sensory overload feels like to people with the condition    my brain gets insanely analytical about all the eccentricities of the skin  the way their eyes look and all the flipping detail   reveals morel   he then goes on to describe how having asperger s is like listening to lots of different songs layered over one another    think of a song that you really like  and it s like  oh this is kind of fun    he says   and then another tune or another layer is added on to it  and then another layer  and another song starts

deal with   writes morel in the video description   he goes on to explain that it is a very  varied condition   so it s important to bear in mind that not everyone with asperger s will suffer in the same way   he adds   i wanted to collaborate on this film was because i wanted to be useful in any way i can and it sounded fun    the video comes after danielle jacobs  who also has asperger s

weight  losing weight can be a minefield with conflicting advice and fad diets coming from every direction   however  the weight-loss process may have just got a lot easier thanks to a new invention by the us government   the national institute of health  an off shoot of the us department of health  has revealed a new calculator to guide those on a health kick   the organisation has released a free body weight planner which is believed to be one of the most scientifically precise yet  it uses a mathematical model informed by the latest research on weight loss in order to give users a realistic idea of how much they can lose and what they have to do to ensure the weight falls off   the new tool by the united states government uses a carefully modeled mathematical formula  users enter their current weight  their goal weight and the date by which they wish to lose it  they also give details of additional factors such as age  height and physical activity level   it then calculates precisely how many calories you can have per day in order to achieve your weight-loss goal   kevin hall phd  a senior investigator at the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases  who created the tool  said  “we originally intended the body weight planner as a research tool  but so many people wanted to use it for their own weight management that we knew we

laws are putting women s lives at risk says un report  a united nations committee has expressed concern about northern ireland s  highly restrictive  abortion laws  a united nations committee of 18 independent experts has expressed concern about “highly restrictive” abortion laws in a report on northern ireland   the report  complied by the un’s human rights committee  made the observations in a wider assessment of a range of rights issues in the united kingdom   unlike in other parts of the uk  abortion in northern ireland remains illegal aside from extremely restricted circumstances  at present  a woman can only have a legal abortion if a pregnancy can be proven to endanger the woman’s life  or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health   the report stated that they are  concerned about the highly restricted circumstances in which termination of pregnancy is permitted under the law in northern ireland  and about the severe criminal sanctions for unlawful abortion  thus putting women s life and health at risk and forcing them to travel in order to seek abortion     the committee notes with concern that the department of justice for northern ireland  after having held a consultation on the possible decriminalisation and legalisation of abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality and pregnancy as a result of rape or incest  indicated in april 2015 that it would propose legislation to legalise termination of pregnancy only in circumstances of fatal foetal abnormality due to  complex issues  raised by pregnancy as a result of sexual crimes    the northern ireland parliament at stormont the report concluded with recommendations  calling upon northern ireland s authorities to  as a matter of priority  amend its legislation on abortion in northern ireland with a view to providing for additional exceptions to the legal ban on abortion  including in cases of rape  incest  and fatal foetal abnormality     the state party should also ensure access to information on abortion  contraception and sexual and reproductive health options    but mara clarke  the director of the abortion support network  believes there is still a long way to go  labelling the current laws “barbaric ”  speaking to the independent  ms clarke said  “we wholeheartedly agree with any pressure that is put upon northern ireland to loosen its barbaric abortion laws  not only do these laws harm women  they also frighten doctors and other medical professionals into silence  so that women aren’t even able to access information in some cases ”  the abortion support network is a grassroots charity that raises money to help women afford the £400-£2000 that it costs for women in northern ireland to get an abortion in other parts of the united kingdom   “as an organisation  we regularly hear from women pregnant as a result of rape  as well as from couples whose much wanted pregnancies have been diagnosed with fatal foetal anomalies  however  until such time as all women in northern ireland are able to access safe and legal abortions at home  we will still be here to help them raise the funds required ”  a spokesperson for the northern ireland department of justice told the independent that  the justice minister david ford remains committed to legislation on abortion in cases of fatal fetal abnormality  and continues to advance the issue with executive colleagues   your bmi isn t low enough for treatment  the deadly approach britain is taking to anorexia  you tell yourself you don t need  want or deserve help – and when that is confirmed by a doctor saying you re not ill enough and you weigh too much for treatment  where else is there to go but down   “you ve got a chicken pox on your neck ”  that was my nephew s diagnosis of what was actually just a mole  but a decent effort  delivered with an appropriate amount of worry and panic   i felt fine and wasn t really worried  but thought i d mention how the mole had grown darker and maybe changed shape when i next saw my gp  two days later i had a letter referring me to the outpatient clinic at the local hospital and within two weeks it had been whipped off  stitched up and tested for anything nasty  turned out i was fine   when i was seven i wrote in a school book that my new year s resolution was to lose weight  my teacher rang my mum but i insisted that i was fine  it was nothing  i didn t mean it  i don t even know if i did mean it – i was an active  fit  healthy girl and don t recall feeling fat at that age - but i did act on it   i d chuck my sandwiches in the bin on the way out of school  a hawk-eyed parent told my mum and once again i was confronted  once again  i said i was fine  i had to hide it better  this new habit  i d sit at lunch  wait until the dinner lady wasn t watching  wrap up my food and dispose of it in the toilet afterwards  some would end up staying in my bag  or be transferred to my wardrobe where they d rot  it stank  so my parents would pull me up again  again  i was fine   this skipping of meals  hiding  lying and deceiving went on throughout the rest of primary school and into secondary  where it was even easier to hide  great stuff  i thought   then i got dragged to the doctor where i admitted that i d been skipping meals for years  i told them i d started skipping breakfast when i could  and sometimes attempted to get out of tea  and when i did have to have tea i d immediately go speed-walking and spend all night not sleeping  but doing sit-ups   “are you menstruating ”  “yes ”  “you re ok for now then  nothing to worry about ”  i had periods   i was functioning   i was fine   so i carried on  there d be the odd worried look or whispered rumour or call home from school but nothing serious  the school nurse would weigh me and worry  but it wasn t like i was dying or anything  i was fine  i got a bit gothy and would hide in stupidly massive baggy black trousers and layers of net and mesh and chunky knit  it s cold  being skinny   i became aware that other girls were dieting  copying whatever fads there mums were into – but i wasn t interested in dieting  diet wasn t a big enough word   “you ve lost a bit of weight since last time i saw you ”  “i know ”  “come back in 6 months ”  i was about 17  i d walk miles to and from college and those silly baggy trousers and skirt would hang off my hips  but now there were no teachers and new friends and more time to spend away from home  away from food  i didn t go back in 6 months   being away from home at university allowed me to do what  by then  i d got pretty good at doing  slow hand clap at being good at losing weight  what a success story  i d come back in the holidays and get smaller each time  fragile but ferocious if anyone dared to ask if there was anything wrong with me  i was fine   things spiralled fast and my time there became a blur of starvation and tears and blackouts and drinking and puking and internet and starving and crying and bleeding and not bleeding and running and laxatives and puking and drinking and diet pills from god knows where and running and fainting and starving   “if you run even 5k  you re risking your life ”  “but i ve not fainted for a while ”  “you could go into cardiac arrest at any second – i m referring you to the psych team     you re quite thin  but i m not going to lose any sleep over you ”  my gp at university was the first to refer me  i was zombified and had no fight in me  so went along to the psych – and those were her actual words after i d spent an hour with her  so  i was still fine   if you spend over half your life telling yourself something  you ll start to believe it  i was fine at a low weight  with a low blood pressure and no control over myself or my mood or my nutritional intake  and this was continually reinforced by dismissive doctors and other health professionals  i live  therefore i m fine   eating disorders don t go away by themselves  when an illness lasts for that many years  it is deeply ingrained  the evil thing about anorexia and bulimia is that the fear of gaining weight and desperation to lose weight is more important than any of the risks you take along the way   asking for help goes against everything an eating disorder stands for  you tell yourself you don t need help  don t deserve help – and when that is confirmed by a doctor or funding body saying that your bmi is too high for treatment  you weigh too much  you re not ill enough  where else is there to go but down   the number of children and teenagers seeking help for an eating disorder has risen by 110 per cent in the past three years  but young people are still being told they need to lose weight so their body mass index is low enough to qualify for treatment   after over ten years of living and struggling with anorexia  bulimia and depression  i got the treatment that i needed  but i had to fight for it and that destroyed me  i cried down a phone  begging for the very thing that i was scared of the most  many people won t do that and too many end up too ill to ever recover  or dead   bmi is bull      it is not a measure of sickness or of health   just as my mole was spotted and treated immediately  even as just a precaution  so should all symptoms of eating disorders  that s really how simple it is  just take it seriously  treat people with respect and it will save us all a lot of time  money and lives how the death of their baby has led one couple to relieve the distress of other sick children  when their beloved toddler son died suddenly  hannah and david cole vowed to find meaning in their loss  they tell anthea gerrie about their campaign in his memory   if we can t have our charmed life any more  let s make it an amazing one   hannah cole entreated her husband david  as they stood  stunned  in a hospital ward in june last year   it was an appeal to make sense of the bleakest of unexpected events  they had just lost their 16-month-old son oscar to a random infection they never imagined would be life-threatening  and hannah was clutching at a way forward    your first thought is   how can i continue to go on living when my child is no longer on this planet   says hannah  who admits to preoccupations such as  wanting to be the hostess with the mostest  in the aforementioned charmed life   we had two lovely children  a beautiful home  good jobs  a nice circle of friends – we couldn t imagine this could ever have happened to our strong  happy son    indeed  there were no concerns for oscar  born in february 2013 weighing 9lbs 6oz and apparently bursting with health until  at 15 months  he started spiking repeated fevers   we were in and out of the gp s surgery in april and may last year  and on 1 june he was admitted to hospital because they couldn t figure out what was wrong    it was hannah herself who found the clue as she held oscar tight against her body to keep him still while a blood sample was taken   i felt a lump on his back  which proved to be osteomyelitis  an infection of the bone in his spine    a six-week course of antibiotics was prescribed and oscar was discharged a few days later  after a picc line  a central catheter  had been inserted  but when the line became infected  he was readmitted to the john radcliffe children s hospital    on day 14  he became very unwell – we think it must have been because encephalitis was kicking in  though no-one knew that at the time – and within days he was dead   says hannah  who remembers that  unusually  they were both at the the hospital   our daughter holly  with whom one of us always stayed home while the other was at the hospital  was sleeping over with my parents    but even though she had been called in urgently  she admits   it came as a terrible shock to be told   you re not going to be taking oscar home   the most frightening nightmare imaginable was playing out in front of us  it was an almost physical sensation  which made me understand why people describe it as like being hit by a train   she adds   my parents came to the hospital  and it was as horrific as you might expect  with oscar covered in tubes  but the nurses laid him on a duvet and he looked beautiful    hannah and david cole at their home in kirtlington  oxfordshire  their son oscar  left  died last year after developing encephalitis oscar was kept on life support until holly could be brought in to say goodbye to her brother   we took advice not to decorate the words and tell her  oscar s asleep  or  he s passed on   but simply to say   oscar has died and we will never see him again    then everyone went back to the coles  house and left david and hannah to spend a last couple of hours alone with oscar  they held him until his last heartbeat  and then said goodbye    we ve asked ourselves many times if we left too soon   hannah says   but he was dead and holly was at home and we felt that night  of all nights  we should be there to put her to bed  we had a thanksgiving for oscar three weeks later  and then a private funeral  and he s buried in the churchyard in our village    since then  the couple  who live in the cotswold stone village of kirtlington and work in software sales and marketing  have been bent on their mission for the  amazing  life they agreed on in the hospital ward   by that  we meant achieving something remarkable in oscar s name – fundraising  making a difference  having an impact  we aspire to being able to reflect in 20 years on something important we have been able to accomplish    they knew early on that whatever they did wouldn t be directly concerned with what happened to oscar  because those particular events were so unusual  there wouldn t be any point in fighting for a cause that might affect one in a million  instead  their charity  called thinking of oscar  is designed to be as broad as possible and is directed at improving the experience of children and their families in hospital   after organising a christmas delivery of books and toys to hospitals  the couple set about raising money to help circumvent the most upsetting aspect of oscar s treatment   he had to have dozens of blood tests taken and cannulas inserted over the course of two-and-a-half weeks  and getting his hands and feet prodded for those tests was the one thing which really distressed him   explains hannah   david read about a device called an accuvein  which illuminates tiny veins that  in babies  are obscured by their rolls of fat  making the insertion of needles more difficult   we could immediately see the benefit – if it had only been available to oscar   explains david   it was so horrible for him to go through the procedure of having anaesthetic put into his hands and having them wrapped in cling film for a while before trying to take blood  if they can t find the veins in a baby s hands  they go through the same procedure with their feet  and if they still can t find one  they go to the head    in fact  87 nhs departments have purchased an accuvein  with a further 48 awaiting funding  according to uk distributors q medical  though they do not necessarily go to children s wards  the coles have funded four for the hospital where oscar was treated  they are now raising £100 000 for a pediatric procedures unit to alleviate the other trauma faced by young children  who currently have to be wheeled to the main hospital when a general anaesthetic is required   they may get bumped from the queue after they have been nil by mouth for six hours and then have to go through that whole process all over again   adds david   as a private act of remembrance  the couple is creating an area in their garden in which to plant roses and other yellow and blue flowers that were sent at the time of oscar s death   we found it helpful to be outside when oscar died  and gardening is something we didn t have time for in our old life  but are making time for  in oscar s memory   says david   the couple have also achieved a very personal ambition for holly  now four-and-a-half  not to remain an only child  barney was born on 26 may this year  bringing new life into a house hannah admits has been  very quiet and very tidy since oscar died     it s nice having a bit more of a hubbub   says hannah   and holly hasn t had any problems adjusting  she misses her brother deeply and grieves like we do  but although that could be triggered  as it is for us  by a piece of music or a little blond head  she s a happy girl most of the time    although it s not a path we would have chosen  every aspect of our life has been richer since oscar died  in spite of the massive void he has left  we never come home and moan about the traffic  we know how lucky we are to have each other and our kids  the lesser known erogenous zones - and how to find them  the genitals undergo a process called vasocongestion  which causes increased blood flow  making them highly sensitive when touched  but where else triggers arousal   the word erogenous comes from the greek eros which means love  and the english genous  meaning producing  an erogenous zone is an area of the human body that has heightened sensitivity  which  when stimulated  may create a sexual response such as relaxation  thoughts of sexual fantasies  sexual arousal and orgasm   there have been many studies and articles about just how many erogenous zones we have in our body  including the iconic scene portrayed on friends when monica teaches chandler about the seven female erogenous zones  however  there may be many more   the human body is highly sensitive to touch and experiencing sexual pleasure is different for everyone - what feels sexually arousing for one person may be repulsive for another   when anybody talks about erogenous zones  their immediate thoughts go to the obvious body parts  such as the breasts  nipples  clitoris  g-spot and penis as these are the sexual areas of our bodies and are more erogenous than others due largely on the amount of nerve endings located in that area  the genitals undergo a process called vasocongestion  which causes increased blood flow to these areas  making them highly sensitive when aroused and touched   however  there are many areas on our bodies that have less nerve endings but can still be erogenous  depending on the way in which they are touched  such as the eyelids  forearm  abdomen and head which can elicit a sexual response   spending time exploring your own body and that of your partner is a pleasurable way to discover exactly what turns you on sexually and what you really don’t like   understanding erogenous zones is also important to people who experience decreased sexual sensation as a result of illness  disease  disability  injury or following surgery to ensure that they can still enjoy sexual pleasure and function  this also applies to people undergoing gender reassignment surgery or breast augmentation   we all know the familiar erogenous zones  but there are parts of your body that you may be neglecting which can produce a sexual response   the brain  not commonly thought of as an erogenous zone  the brain is in fact the largest on the body as it makes the connection between visual stimulation and physical touch   as humans  many of us enjoy sensual touch though gentle caresses and feather like kisses  but the brain reacts just as strongly to seeing another person being caressed  according to research from the sahlgrenska academy at the university of gothenburg  sweden  2011    being gently caressed by another person can elicit both a physical and emotional response and they found that the brain reacted not only stronger when a person was being stroked slowly  but also when a person watched a video of another person being caressed as if they were being touched themselves   being in the right frame of mind also affects how you perceive sexual stimulation  so concentrating on what is happening to your body is important   who is touching you  the gentle breath on the back of your neck  a brush of the knee or feather like kiss on your hand can produce a sexual sensation  depending on who is delivering the touch and to whom  we all know that unwanted touch can be highly aversive and unpleasant  ticklish feet affect many people and they will not enjoy having their feet kissed  massaged or their toes sucked   in 2012  the california institute of technology measured brain response in heterosexual males who were gently touched on the leg whilst they were being scanned in an mri scanner  they watched a video of a woman caressing their leg and then watched a man repeating the same touch   the men reported the experience as pleasurable when they thought the touch came from a woman and aversive when they thought it was a man and their brains showed the same response   unknown to the subjects they were touched by the same woman on both occasions but it felt different for them when they believed a man versus a woman was doing the touching  this shows that the brain not only responds to basic touch but also the emotional and social message conveyed through touch   your eyes  not considered an obvious erogenous part of the body  just looking at a person in a certain way or being watched can create sexual pleasure and sensations  from shivers down your spine to feeling breathless  pupils dilate when we are aroused  making us appear more attractive to the opposite sex  the longer the eye contact between two people  the greater and deeper the intimacy   the lips  a kiss is like a drug triggering a cocktail of hormones and neurotransmitters to flow through our bodies and brain  kissing keeps our bodies busy interpreting numerous signals distributed by billions of small nerve connections   some women can experience an orgasm from prolonged kissing without genital contact  which may seem unusual  but our lips are the most exposed erogenous part of our bodies  they contain a huge number of nerve endings which send a flood of information to our brains  making us feel good  they are 100 times more sensitive than fingers   how and where you are kissed can create sexual arousal too  many people are gently aroused when their eyelids  eyebrows  temples  shoulders  hands  arms and hair are subtly touched either by fingers  hands or lips   the neck  collarbone area and the back of the neck are very sensitive in both males and females  which can be stimulated by licking  kissing or light caressing   many people who experience spinal cord injury can enjoy sexual pleasure and sensation through sensual touch of the body above the injury  some individuals find the skin surface around the neurological level to have heightened tactile sexual response and is found to be extremely erotic and pleasurable   the lesser known orgasm  we’ve all heard of clitoral and g-spot orgasms but have you ever had a cervical orgasm  commonly referred to in tantric sex  a cervical orgasm is felt throughout your body with continuing waves of pleasure  this can feel like pleasurable tingling and vibrations throughout your whole body and being  and can keep going for hours  as opposed to a clitoral orgasm  which typically lasts for seconds  most women can achieve a cervical orgasm through penetrative sex or using a longer  girthier sex toy   body mapping  body mapping is a simple self-exploration technique in which people who experience decreased sexual sensation as a result of conditions such as multiple sclerosis can enjoy sexual pleasure  this involves gently touching all parts of your body to identify sensual pleasure  discomfort or sensory change  this is not only helpful for people with ms  but generally to find areas on your body you weren’t even aware were sexually arousing   sensate focus is a technique commonly used for sexual therapy which involves exploring each other’s bodies to find areas that are highly erotic  one person sits with their back against their partner’s chest and legs around each other  the person on front concentrates on their breathing and relaxing while their partner explores their body through gentle touch  they then switch  this can also be done in front of a mirror   the feet  used for centuries to stimulate organs  reflexology restores the body’s natural balance and promote the healing process and can boost your sex life too   the inside and outside of the ankles are sensitive spots with many nerve endings that correspond directly to the most important erogenous zones of the body  the vagina  penis  uterus and prostate   the reflex areas located just below the ankle bones correspond to the ovaries and testicles  responsible for helping fertility  increasing libido and improving sexual performance   the middle upper part of the soles of the feet respond to the chest and can send waves of sexual energy to the breasts and nipples   our bodies are covered in skin  one of the most erogenous zones in our body due to having some many nerve endings  however and wherever you enjoy being touched  finding your own erogenous zones is fun and will increase your sexual stimulation  so start exploring - you may be surprised at what sets your sexual pleasure soaring world hepatitis day we have a cure for hepatitis c  but it s not offered to sufferers until it s too late  160 000 people in england alone live with the virus  yet only half are aware of it  writes mandy tyson from the terrence higgins trust  without treatment it can lead to liver disease  and deaths have quadrupled over 15 years  hepatitis c is a silent killer  a virus isolated as recently as 1989 when an infection damaging the liver was identified which wasn’t hepatitis a or b   up to 150 million people live with the virus globally  many without realising it and approximately 500 000 people die each year from hepatitis c-related liver disease    hepatitis c can exist undetected for decades   approximately 160 000 people in england alone live with the hepatitis c virus  yet fewer than half are aware of it   the government report ‘hepatitis c in the uk  2014’ revealed that across the whole of the uk around 214 000 individuals have long-term  chronic  infection with hepatitis c  and not surprisingly hepatitis c-related end-stage liver disease is continuing to rise   hepatitis c virus as recently as 2013 we know that deaths and hospital admissions from liver disease caused by hepatitis c had quadrupled over 15 years  easy access to screening and treatment is a fundamental issue for those who are co-infected with both hepatitis c and hiv  the uk needs to establish wide access to screening  via a broad range of services  including services for those net engaged with primary care or other healthcare provision  this doesn’t need to be a groundbreaking and much can be learned from the experience and methods used to expand access to hiv testing    for example  where appropriate hepatitis c could be offered along with hiv testing  and be routinely tested in pregnant women  as hepatitis b is now  and where services and professionals express concern and fear of causing offence  they need reassurance that people accept that today s uk is a richly diverse population  some of whom are at risk of contracting hepatitis c  many of whom may not know it   once viewed as the problem of intravenous drug use  we now accept that sexual transmission of the hepatitis c virus is possible  we also know that unlike hiv this virus is so robust that it can exist on surfaces outside of the body for a number of days  but like hiv mother to baby transmission can occur   hepatitis c sufferers hold placards during a demonstration at spain s health ministry in december 2014  saying they are being denied access to a new drug that could cure them of the deadly liver disease benefits of wider access to screening will identify people living with hepatitis c earlier making it more possible to treat them earlier and keep them healthier   it will also give people a chance to make lifestyle changes that will protect their health  and others who may have not known they could have been at risk of being infected  eg sexual partners  it also allows sexual health organisations such as terrence higgins trust the opportunity to inform and advise at risk groups  using tools such as hepatitis c – the facts for gay men   huge successes and treatment advances have recently produced a cure for hepatitis c  but in england  people are currently made to wait until their illness reaches a chronic stage  before being offered new treatments that can cure their condition   the new treatments are easier for patients to take and tolerate and can result in a cure within 12 weeks   for instance  on the drug harvoni people are only required to take one pill per day  a significant departure from when treatment comprised of ribavirin pills and interferon injections for almost a year  and then there was no guarantee of a cure   if you have a cure for a disease  as we do with hepatitis c  it is a critical missed opportunity not to offer it to those who need it  the benefits of early treatment  as opposed to waiting until the person reaches an advanced state  whether it be hepatitis c or hiv  are now well documented   holding back treatment will only increase the number of people with declining health and heighten the risk of people developing liver cancer or end-stage liver disease  cirrhosis   last month nhs england announced a budget increase for new virological cures for hepatitis c  however this is still reserved for people whose livers have developed cirrhosis  and leaves the reminder of those with hepatitis c to await this fate until they too can access their cure   this is not likely to be cost-effective and is a huge missed opportunity to improve public health eight-year-old boy zion harvey says of double hand transplant –  it feels weird  but good   the hospital has waived any additional costs not covered by expenses  an eight-year-old boy who was forced to have his hands and feet removed after he suffered a serious infection has become the youngest person in the us to receive a double hand transplant   doctors at the children’s hospital of philadelphia performed the 11-hour operation on zion harvey  from the suburbs of baltimore  maryland  in june   a 40-person-strong team of medics used steel plate and screws to graft together the old and new bones  before carrying out the meticulous task of reconnecting the child’s arteries  veins  muscles  tendons and nerves   days after the procedure was made public  the young boy appeared at a press conference with heavily bandaged hands  where he demonstrated his new grip   zion said waking up with new hands was “weird at first  but then good ”  “he woke up smiling ” said dr  l  scott levin  who heads the hand transplant program  “there hasn t been one whimper  one tear  one complaint ”  zion harvey with his mother pattie ray tuesday  zion’s ordeal began as a toddler when he contracted sepsis  which triggered multiple organ failure and the forced the amputation of his hands and feet   by age 4  zion needed a kidney transplant  which was donated to him by his mother  pattie ray   after losing his hands  the young child learned to use his forearms to write  eat and play video games   doctors now hope that zion will make his dreams of throwing a football and swinging on the monkey bars a reality   dr  l  scott levin holds zion harvey s hands as he moves his fingers   addressing the potential risk of allowing her son to undergo the operation  ms ray told reporters  “it was no more of a risk than a kidney transplant  so i felt like i was willing to take that risk for him  if he wanted it ”  several adults in the us were given new arms or hand over the past few years  however hospital officials believe zion is the youngest person to have the surgery in the states   zion must now take drugs to suppress his immune system’s response to the foreign hands  or else his body may reject them   his body has already reacted well to the anti-rejection drugs he must take following his kidney transplant  meaning he was a good candidate for the hand transplant  doctors said   children s hospital said it would not hold zion s family liable for any costs beyond that which may be covered by medical insurance   how to behave with disabled people a new guide tells you what to do and what not to do  if you re unsure  you re not alone  says wheelchair user scott jordan harris  now a new guide uses humour to take the fear out of it all  the majority of people who are not disabled feel awkward around those  like me  who are  most don t admit it publicly  but statistics show it to be true  scope  britain s leading disability charity  conducted a survey into attitudes to disability and the results are astonishing   sixty-seven per cent of british people feel so awkward around disabled people they either panic or avoid all contact with us  forty-eight per cent have never started a conversation with a disabled person  seventy-six per cent have never invited a disabled person to a social occasion and only 16 per cent have invited one of us into their homes  saddest of all  only five per cent of people who are not disabled have ever asked out  or been on a date with  someone who is  to put all this in context  disabled people make up 18 per cent of the population  that s just under one in five   the most important result to come from scope s survey is  end the awkward   the campaign it inspired the charity to begin   not enough people know a disabled person or know enough about disability   says mark atkinson  scope s interim chief executive   that s why scope launched end the awkward – it aims to tackle the awkwardness that many people feel about disability   part of the initiative involves teaming up with channel 4 to release a series of short films called  what not to do    the films feature alex brooker  co-host of channel 4 s friday-night talk show the last leg  and they typically show two actors  one disabled and one able-bodied  acting out an awkward social scenario based on the real-life experiences of disabled people  there s a blind man on a faltering first date  a woman with cerebral palsy cringing through a visit to a nail bar  and an amputee on his first day working for a boss who is so desperate not to do anything embarrassing that she embarrasses everyone in the room   the people around the actors are members of the public who don t know that they are being filmed and don t know the conversations they are overhearing are scripted  interspersed with the hidden camera footage are shots of brooker reacting to it  sometimes he winces  sometimes he laughs  and sometimes he gasps with disbelief  crucially  though  the films don t aim to demonise able-bodied people or even to make them feel at fault    when i was first asked to get involved with end the awkward  i said i didn t want to do anything that was trying to make able-bodied people feel bad   brooker tells me   end the awkward is the opposite of that  i ve seen disability campaigns before and they re always hard-hitting  what i like about end the awkward is there s humour to it  it isn t about telling people what to do  in a way  it s about making them feel better  it s not wrong to feel a little bit awkward    brooker is a clever choice to front the campaign  he s funny  approachable  a bit of a lad and  despite often playing the role of comically confused sidekick on the last leg  keenly intelligent  he is also  as he once memorably told then-deputy prime minister nick clegg on the show  one of britain s  top disableds     i think it s human nature to be curious  and i don t think anyone should feel bad about that   he says   if you ask most disabled people a question  they re not going to mind    alex brooker  left  films  what not to do  for channel 4  paul rowland  brooker is right  most of us don t mind answering a question or two about our disabilities  especially if it lets us defuse the awkwardness in a social situation  but awkwardness can come from too many questions as well as too few  disabled people don t want to be treated as information desks about disability   having a disability is just one aspect of you   is how brooker puts it   ultimately  it doesn t actually matter  when you interact with anyone  you re talking to the person  not their disability    that doesn t mean  though  that able-bodied people need to pretend they don t see our physical challenges  we don t want our disabilities to be ignored  but we don t want to be interrogated about them either  this is a difficult mix and i always feel bad for able-bodied people i see struggling with it  brooker agrees   i think it s a hard balance to get   he says   i really do   after reading the results of scope s survey  i asked able-bodied friends why they feel awkward around disabled people  the answers were often touching  sian meades  a writer  summed up a recurring issue   i don t want to draw attention to the fact that i m trying not to draw attention to someone s disability   most awkward silences come from kind people being afraid of saying the wrong thing and consequently opting to say nothing at all  but if disabled people only ever encounter awkward silences  we never get to talk to anyone    other able-bodied people told me they avoid interacting with disabled people because they re worried about being seen as prejudiced if they say something  wrong   but awkwardness and prejudice are drastically different  someone who is awkward around a disabled person is unlikely to be truly prejudiced  awkwardness comes from a person wanting to do good and worrying they ll get it wrong  a prejudiced person wouldn t care enough to worry    just because you re awkward around a disabled person doesn t mean it s a hate crime   says brooker   the two are on completely opposite ends of the spectrum  just because someone doesn t shake my hand properly  it doesn t make them a bad person  awkwardness comes from people wanting to make someone else feel comfortable    and awkwardness around disabilities is not limited to the able-bodied  disabled people can be uneasy around other disabled people  too  i use a wheelchair  brooker has hand disabilities and had a leg amputated as a baby  my health troubles – i have me – make it hard for me to leave the house  so i speak to brooker over the phone  but if we d met in person he might reasonably have felt awkward about whether he should bend down to talk to me in my chair and i might reasonably have felt awkward about whether to shake his hand   a welcome side-effect of end the awkward is that it educates disabled people about how to interact with those who have different disabilities  no one is immune to social anxiety and no-one has experience of talking to people with every possible disability    there will always be a degree of awkwardness in a lot of social interactions   says brooker   people are awkward in general  if you get on the tube in london and you don t have to sit near somebody  you won t  that s just because of the way we are as british people  we don t like interacting  no one wants to talk to anyone  especially in london    i laugh at this and brooker realises it is perhaps not completely on-message   the big message   he says   is to treat people as people  deal with who they are  don t feel bad  it s human nature to be awkward  just see that you re talking to a person  it doesn t matter what they ve got up with them  you re still talking to a person  don t let awkwardness consume you  because if it goes on too long it just becomes weird  and you don t want to be the weirdo in the office   µ  channel 4 s scope s shorts series   what not to do   can be seen on all 4 from today  channel4 com all4  what not to do    don t be afraid to talk to us  we re just people     but don t feel you have to talk to every disabled person you see to prove you re not awkward around us     don t be afraid to ask a question about our disabilities  but don t just talk about our disabilities  there is much more to us     don t assume physical impairment also means mental impairment  or vice versa      don t talk to us loudly and slowly – unless we tell you we have hearing problems     never touch a disabled person s wheelchair or disability aids without permission  they re extensions of our bodies     if you feel truly awkward  don t be afraid to admit it  we ll probably laugh with you  the pretence that things aren t awkward only makes them worse     if you have a bad experience talking to one disabled person  don t let it put you off talking to others  you wouldn t stop talking to all able-bodied people just because you once had an awkward conversation with one     don t worry too much  however awkward a situation is  we ve probably been in worse nudist cruise ship what s it like on a boat with 2 000 people not wearing clothes  when mark haskell smith joined a naturist cruise  he was alarmed by the brazen display of saggy  baggy and dangly bits  so  how did a  cottontail  cope amid those bronzed bottoms  and why were his fellow  nakationers  gawping at his manhood    we are safely away and you can now enjoy a     there was a pause  as if the cruise director was having trouble choosing what  exactly  he should call what was about to happen  finally he said      a carefree environment    the announcement was still reverberating through the ship when the scrotum airing began in earnest  shorts and shirts dropped to the ground and penises dangled in the south florida sun  permission had been granted  now buttocks could swing from side to side with no restrictions  and breasts – finally released from the prison of blouse and brassiere – burst into the open  to be caressed by soft tropical breezes  we were on a boat  one thousand  eight hundred and sixty-six nudists living the  anti-textile  dream   not that some of them weren t almost nude before the cruise director gave the all clear  many were in various states of undress  itching to toss their clothes aside  a skeletal man in his eighties wandered around the ship wearing only a fluorescent thong  his loose skin draped around his bones in cascades that looked like freckled frosting  and a gigantic  barrel-chested man – he looked like he d eaten an actual barrel – lumbered around the lido deck on an industrial-strength cane  wearing only a loincloth  a few people soaked in jacuzzis  surreptitiously slipping out of their swimsuits  while the less rebellious sat by the pool  looking somewhat forlorn  waiting for the green light  these were nudists  after all  and they had paid big bucks to frolic in the buff  when the all clear was sounded  they didn t hesitate   there are rules for being a nudist  it s not enough to drop your trousers and waggle your genitals in the sunshine  that might be fun – or  depending where you are  get you arrested – but it s not nudism  you can take off your clothes and run across a football field  but that s not nudism  that s streaking  jump in a lake and frolic naked with several of your friends  that s skinny-dipping  fun  but not nudism  even bathing in a japanese onsen isn t nudism  yes  you re naked and with other naked people in a hot spring  but after you ve cleaned and refreshed in the cold plunge  you get dressed and go out for ramen  a nudist would eat noodles naked  with other naked people   nudists enjoy life on the ocean wave  alamy  various groups have different agendas and interpretations  but they all pretty much agree that nudism is a social activity  if you re alone  you re just naked  but if you are in a mixed group of men and women engaged in the conscious practice of standing around in the buff  then you are a nudist practising nudism   i had never been on a cruise ship before – i d never even been interested in being on a cruise ship – but this wasn t just any cruise  this was the big nude boat  a special charter offered by bare necessities  the premier  nakation   a portmanteau of  naked  and  vacation   but you probably figured that out  travel agency  not only that  the cruise was on board the nieuw amsterdam  one of the holland america line s more luxurious ships  which meant this was the deluxe version of non-sexual social nude recreation  meaning nudism  or naturism  depending on who you ask  there are several theories floating around about which word means what – historically speaking there are some actual distinctions – but the reality was that i was on a boat with almost 2 000 people who weren t wearing clothes   i am fascinated by subcultures  the deadheads and juggalos who have built unique cultures out of following their favourite bands as they tour the country  the amateur mechanical engineers who build robots in their garages  the home brewers who experiment with beer in their kitchens and the foodies who eat at illegal restaurants in people s homes  people do strange things  they collect stamps and watch trains  they dress their pets to look like famous characters from movies  they dress themselves to look like anime characters  they go to conventions in woodland animal costumes and have group sex in  plushie piles    all of these activities have their own culture  a network of people who speak a specific kind of lingo that outsiders don t understand  i m especially fascinated by subcultures that are deemed morally suspect or quasi-legal  the people who pursue their passion even if it means possible imprisonment or stigmatisation by society  i can t help it  i like the true believers  the fanatics   my first nonfiction book was about cannabis connoisseurs and the underground botanists who source heirloom varietals of marijuana from all over the world  cannabis culture has a rich history  filled with colourful characters  these are men and women who defy oppressive anti-drug laws and good-naturedly don t give a fuck about societal norms  it wasn t much of a leap for me to become intrigued by the world of nudism  or as my wife said   first you re stoned all the time and now you re going to be naked  why can t you write a book about cheese  you like cheese    if you re alone  you re just naked  but if you are in a group standing around in the buff  then you are a nudist  afp getty  the loudspeaker on the ship crackled to life and the cruise director added a caveat   i would like to remind you that you must wear a cover-up in the dining areas   which didn t really keep anyone from being naked in the dining areas  or in the bars  or anywhere for that matter  they were naked on deck and in the screening room  the library  the casino and the buffet line  nudists crowded around the piano bar and requested songs by elton john and billy joel  the large theatre where stage shows were presented was filled with naked men and women  they were in the elevators  walking down the corridors  playing ping pong  lifting weights in the gym  and guzzling cocktails by the pool   in the fitness centre someone asked the ship s in-house yoga teacher if people had to wear clothes in the yoga classes  the teacher gave her a curious look and then  as the true reality of the question sunk in – what i can only imagine was the image of a roomful of naked people doing downward-facing-dog flashing through her head – her face bloomed in panic and she said   oh yeah  in the class  clothes  you have to wear clothes    but other than the yoga class  everywhere you looked  testicles and breasts hung low and pendulous  swaying side to side as the boat rocked in the open ocean  billows of bulbous flesh spilling off torsos  flowing earthward like the goop inside a lava lamp  the entire human body presented in all its natural nature was unavoidably on display   i was sitting at what was called the ocean bar that first evening when i overheard a man  a silver-haired smoothy  complain loudly that there were too many old people on the cruise   i m guessing the median age is 65   he said  he was 62  when old people complain that there are too many old people  then you really know there are too many old people  most of the passengers were retirees and most of them were american  which is to say that there were a lot of overweight people strutting around in their birthday suits   that they did so unselfconsciously  without any hint of the neurotic body obsession that has created generations of diet-obsessed  bulimic  anorexic or just plain miserable people  was something that i found almost inspirational  they weren t ashamed of their bodies  they seemed to accept themselves and one another for who they are and what they were and  best of all  they had fun doing it   not all of them were retired  i met a harvard professor  a radiologist  a tool salesman and a couple of people serving in the armed forces  there were pharmaceutical sales reps  retail clerks  photographers  scientists  doctors  corporate executives  teachers  lawyers  paralegals and people who really didn t want to talk about work while they were on holiday   and of course not everyone was fat and saggy  there was a large lgbt contingent who were on the healthy end of the body mass index  and there were some actual bona fide young people  trim and tattooed men and women in their twenties who clung together as if the naked retirees were harbingers of some sort of terrifying apocalypse  the naked twentysomethings gazed at the naked seventysomethings as if they could suddenly see the future  like a portal had opened in the space-time continuum and revealed a dystopian world where gravity and a sedentary lifestyle conspired to make everyone expand and sag  it was heartbreakingly inevitable  perhaps this glimpse into the abyss explained some of the uninhibited alcohol consumption among the younger set   the guests on the nude cruise were for the most part caucasian  although there were a few south asians  east asians  and african-americans in the clothes-free contingent  they came from all over the us and europe  too  canadians from toronto and quebec  and people from finland  australia  germany and the netherlands  all these people  coming for the express purpose of standing around on the lido deck of a cruise ship and letting it all hang out   as i was standing naked in front of these people  i have to say that i didn t feel a sudden sense of liberation  but i didn t feel afraid or ashamed either  my self-esteem didn t increase or decrease  mostly i felt a little awkward  i ve never talked to a naked stranger while being naked before and i was unsure what to say  like  how was i supposed to greet people  would my saying hello be interpreted as overt sexual behaviour  and what were they thinking about me  did i appear unhealthily pale  an obvious first-timer  nudists refer to people with untanned buttocks as  cottontails   i ll be the first to admit my ass doesn t see a lot of sunlight  were they all scoffing and muttering  cottontail  under their breath   i noticed that a couple of the women were violating one of the unspoken rules of nudism –  don t gawk   they were staring at me  their eyes wide   i quickly realised why  it was not my physique or lack of tan that was making them goggle  it was the fact that my penis had become incredibly shiny in the sunlight  the spray-on sunblock that i had so scrupulously and thickly applied had turned my dick into something resembling a solar flare  i could ve sent a distress signal to a search and rescue team   i swam a little  i read a book  i watched a youngish woman with a flower tattooed on her bum walk to the bar and fetch a couple of drinks  i was enjoying non-sexual social nudism  i sat in my chair by the pool  was this a more enjoyable experience than sitting by a pool and reading with a swimsuit on   if i m honest  i have to admit that it was  it felt good to let the sun and the warm desert breeze dry my skin after a dip in the water without the feeling of clammy fabric sticking to my body  admittedly  it was strange to look around and see naked people  but they were doing a pretty standard version of what people on vacation do  reading or snoozing or drinking cocktails and laughing – all in a non-sexual way  naturally  nobody gawked  nobody said anything offensive or racy  it was all very proper   i suppose  for me  it was a bit too proper  but after a while i got used to it  i didn t feel weird or embarrassed or uncomfortable being naked around these people  and the few who would dare talk to a lone naked man were totally friendly   there was nothing else to do but kick back and relax  so i laid out on the chaise longue  my penis reflecting the sun like a chunk of fool s gold 10 practical tips and foods for healthy eyes  less than a quarter of us go for regular check-ups  our eyesight is

your waistline  being overweight can also impact the health of your eyes even if you aren’t experiencing any symptoms or discomfort  the eyes are the only body part where bare nerves and arteries can be seen without cutting the skin  your eyes can expose tell-tale symptoms of cardiovascular disease  diabetes  or diabetic retinopathy  all of which can be caused by being overweight  other conditions that have been linked to obesity are cataracts  idiopathic intracranial hypertension  iih   thyroid eye disease  ted  and exophthalmos   eat well  healthy eating is essential for healthy eyes  for example foods rich in lutein  a vitamin found in leafy greens such as kale  are thought to help delay the onset of amd and cataracts  omega-3 is believed to help reduce your tendency of getting dry eyes and maintain healthier eyes into old age  oily fish like mackerel  tuna and salmon are the best food sources for high levels of omega-3  zinc can help promote better vision and can be found in foods such as cheese  milk and poultry   be active  frequent exercise is essential in maintaining a healthy bmi  which helps fight against cardiovascular disease and diabetes  but it is also important for keeping your eyes healthy  studies have shown a link between a sedentary lifestyle and an increased risk of glaucoma  research at the university of wisconsin paper revealed people who exercise regularly are 70  less likely to develop a degenerative eye disease such as age-related macular degeneration  amd    quit smoking  studies show that only 15  of smokers are concerned about the impact of smoking on their eye health  and yet smoking can have serious implications  studies have shown a strong link between smoking and the development of both amd and cataracts  in fact smokers are four times more likely to develop amd and smoking even impairs the effectiveness of amd treatment  in addition to this a smoker’s risk of developing cataracts goes hand in hand with the number of cigarettes smoked - those who smoke heavily are likely to develop more severe cataracts   watch your alcohol units  drinking in moderation is strongly advised to maintain good overall health  the three factors of poor diet  smoking and alcohol abuse can lead to a toxic  progressive optic neuropathy  optic atrophy  which can cause visual impairment and damage to the optic nerve cells  this damage leaves colours appearing washed in the affected eye  or in severe cases  a loss of vision  it is advised that men drink no more than 21 units of alcohol per week and no more than 4 units in one day  the recommended alcohol intake for women is no more than 14 units per week and 3 units in one day   be careful of harmful sun rays  overexposure to ultraviolet  uv  light for prolonged periods can seriously damage your eyes and in some cases is responsible for causing retinal burning and even blindness  uv light is known to increase risk of amd and cataracts  it is imperative that on bright days sunglasses are worn  if you are feeling discomfort from sun’s rays this may be a sign that your eyes are being damaged  uv levels are at their highest between 10am-2pm so plan accordingly  when buying sunglasses it is advised that you look for sunglasses with the ce standard mark  which is the european standard for safe levels of uv protection  and the british standard mark  bsen 1836 1997   but this doesn’t just apply to warm weather  uv rays can be just as harmful in cold climates with heavy snowfall  snow reflects up to 80  of the sun’s natural uv light  which can cause snow blindness  therefore remember your sunglasses in hot and cold weather   eye care in the workplace  we spend the majority of our time at work and yet this is when we most neglect our eyes  if you work in front of a computer  the 2002 health and safety act requires your employer to provide free eye tests  if you need glasses for reading a computer screen your employer is also obliged to supply these  your screen should be positioned 20 to 24 inches from your eyes with the centre of the screen 10-15 degrees below line of sight  remember to take breaks away from the screen with the 20 20 20 rule  look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes to reduce eye strain   entertainment at home  if video games and watching tv are your ways of relaxing relax  take breaks and remember the 20 20 20 rule  if you are experiencing blurred vision  double vision  eye irritation  headaches  or neck back pain  you should rest your eyes  these symptoms are not serious and should recover after a break from the screen   your age   your eyesight  as we age it’s natural for our eyes to begin to struggle to make out words on the page of a book  screen  or newspaper  this is caused by presbyopia  a common condition in over 40s  which simply requires non-prescription reading glasses to correct vision  both the colleges of ophthalmology and optometry recommend an eye check every two years after the age of 40  this is not only to check for presbyopia but to also exclude more severe conditions that are commonly caused by aging  such as cataracts  amd and glaucoma  all of which could require surgery  these surgical procedures are routine  carry minimal risk and are particularly common in the over 70s   body branding should the police be snooping on our skin  a growing number of tattoo parlours now offer body branding alongside their usual services  but burning a mark into someone else s body – even with their consent – could be a criminal assault   body branding is fast becoming an alternative for people bored with tattooing  a growing number of tattooists now offer this form of scarification alongside their usual services  in the uk  channel 4 recently featured branding in an online body mods series   most people sensibly assume that if an adult consents to a cosmetic procedure that could amount to bodily harm or wounding  their consent would render that act lawful  but in terms of body modification  the law is actually far from clear   and as branding becomes more popular  we could see legal cases brought against the people who brand customers – even if they have been asked to do it  branding involves burning the skin with hot or cold instruments to produce a permanent design  while the visual results may be comparable to a tattoo  the process of actually producing a brand is quite different – which makes it a legal grey area   this first became clear as far back as 1997  when a husband was convicted of grievous bodily harm for branding the letter w on his wife s buttock with a hot knife at her request  when she sought medical attention a few days later  the examining doctor reported the injury to the police   but when the case was taken to appeal  the judge took a practical view  ruling that the husband was merely helping his wife with  a piece of personal adornment  akin to a tattoo  this decision was made following an infamous 1993 case  which saw a group of people convicted of bodily harm after willingly taking part in sadomasochistic activities including whipping  genital maltreatment  ritual beatings and branding   when considering an appeal against the convictions  the majority of the house of lords was clear  consent does not negate liability when bodily harm or more serious injury was intended or caused   but the case did provide some latitude in terms of injuries received in the course of other socially acceptable activities  it was decided that consent negates criminal liability for injuries received in the course of sports  surgery  ritual  male  circumcision  rough horseplay and tattooing and ear piercing   branding is notably absent from the list  at the time  that might not have been a problem  but it now leaves us with a gap  the practice is not the same as tattooing or piercing because rather than the cosmetic piercing of the skin  it involves a deep burn that could be construed as bodily harm   local authorities are responsible for regulating and monitoring businesses that offer cosmetic body piercing  tattooing  micropigmentation  semi-permanent make-up  electrolysis and acupuncture  the local authority will issue a detailed series of  largely hygiene-related  conditions which must be met in order for a licence to be issued for premises that offer these services   but body modification has moved on since 1993 and procedures such as scarification  the cutting or removal of the upper layer of the skin to encourage scarring   tongue splitting and beading  the insertion of beads under the skin  are no longer unusual   the legality of these more serious forms of body modification as commercial activities has not yet been tested in court  but given these procedures result in serious harm  they could be judged unacceptable  even when a customer consents to them  it is not a decision for the injured party whether a prosecution should be brought – it is at the discretion of the police and crown prosecution service   obviously this has also been an issue in other jurisdictions  australia recognised a loophole in the law concerning body modification and its states have acted by regulating  body art   so western australia  for example  allows branding at regulated premises where the customer is over 18 and for minors where they have the written permission of their parent or guardian   local authorities are undoubtedly issuing licences to premises that offer branding and we can assume they are taking a pragmatic view – allowing branding and other forms of body modification to continue alongside tattooing  but once these practices become mainstream – and the popularity of fifty shades of grey raises the same issues regarding sadomasochism – the need to clarify this area of the law becomes ever more pressing hollywood s new diet has la stolen new york s crown as the ultimate foodie trend-setter  what they re eating now at the markets and food trucks of los angeles is what british diners will be tucking into before you can say  cold-pressed broccoli   samuel muston finds out the trends we can expect next from the city that gave us sushi rolls  spiralising and quinoa  a light wind is blowing through the doric columns on the roof of the peninsula hotel in beverly hills  ruffling the jasmine that twists around them  clouds the colour of dreadnoughts begin to muscle in on the blue  the man who looks after the pool worries  “rain’s coming ” he says from behind his reflective ¬sunglasses  as if announcing the imminent arrival of the four horsemen   still  for the moment  the surface of the pool is serene  and i am happy  because in front of me i have one of the simplest  most pleasing dishes i have eaten all summer  it consists of sliced avocado crowned with raw tuna and ¬garnished with a diaphanous golden-yellow disc of freeze-dried pineapple and herbs from the hotel’s garden  it is possibly the most la dish you could imagine  avocado  check  raw protein  check  home-grown  high-level cooking technique casually used  check  but the thing is  if i was eating this same dish in bournemouth  no one would think it was ¬particularly unusual  it would not draw comment in birmingham or bath   both raw fish and avocados are fairly ubiquitous  avocados are so ubiquitous  in fact  that not only do they have tumblrs dedicated to them  people now write articles about them with headlines like  is there such a thing as too much avocado  why is this so  why are these two climactically unsuitable dishes a feature of british cuisine  the answer is simple  los angeles  not so long ago  if you wanted to find out what was going to be the next big foodie thing here  you got on a plane and you went to new york  m s has always maintained an innovations team there  wannnabe london restaurateurs would chivy the latest trends from the eating- and watering-holes of brooklyn and tribeca  yes  that is where sharing plates came from   no longer  though   consider for a minute the big things in food today  the things that are never off the tv and the radio and maybe your own plate  kale  quinoa  juicing  spiralising  california sushi rolls  food trucks  for those  you have to thank la chef roy choi   they were all born and brought up in la before being shipped off to europe as fully fledged trends  you may hate them  you make think they are an affectation  but you cannot deny them  la food is in the ascendant   as dawn davies  grocery manager at selfridges  points out  part of the attraction is the lifestyle  “fresh and healthy as a trend is massive in the uk  and la health is fun health  it’s decadent  it is treat-yourself health  it’s not like  ‘eat nothing  go throw up and eat only apples ’” she says  in fact  an apple wouldn’t do at all – you can’t spiralise an apple   it is not just about one flash of a trend aligning with the uk  either  it is about the place itself  the californian city is the perfect breeding ground for a uk food culture that is forever eating itself  it is a young city – 150 years ago it was a village – a place of films and film stars and all the other accoutrements of ephemeral power and influence that go with those two things  it lives and dies on trends – for people  for things and  most of all  for food   what are the biggest trends today  then  what might we expect to fetch up here soon  the first place we visit is sweetfin poke in santa monica  it is a “pole to bowl” cafe and takeout – ¬specialising in bowls of raw fish with avocado and rice  it tastes divine and also like something that might counterbalance all the beer i drank the night before  it is quick  it is simple  it is raw and it isn’t expensive  as sweetfin’s owner seth cohen says  “it is the natural evolution of sushi  and in la  there seems to be a sushi bar on every corner ”  a sashimi bowl from sweetfin poke  a cafe in santa monica  the focus on eating more protein is something we brits are increasingly cottoning on to  say dawn davies  “people in the uk used to see protein as a negative thing  but today  it’s all about getting good protein  not red meat ” she says  putting protein first is very much la  as you also see at the 194-room  five star peninsula hotel  which occupies the other end of the dining spectrum  this place is a big deal in la  as the line of bentleys and ferraris outside  and the presence of larry flynt in the old-world bar inside attests  it regularly plays host to princes and if you want one of the rooms  let alone one of the bungalows  during awards season  well  you better be up for a gong yourself  the ethos of the place  which is low-rise by comparison to its surroundings  is that it is like a private home  sure  you can have afternoon tea downstairs and dinner in the frenchified main restaurant – but where the restaurant is really on trend is on the roof  aside from the raw dishes  head chef david codney offers  rooftop barbecues – on the roof  protein is king  grilled snapper fish and full chickens roast on the grill   after all that meat  healthy or otherwise  you need your veg  you could  of course  cook this veg  but in la you are more likely to put your broccoli in a high-pressure processing unit that uses approximately seven tons of force to extract all the goodness from it  sound a little extreme  jonathan moore  executive chef at waitrose  has marked the beginnings of the trend here  too  “since the juicing trend began  we sell more kale and avocados than ever  ¬avocados particularly  as they give a nice creamy texture”   in la  they are beyond simply juicing banana and blueberries – “too sugary  darling”  cold-pressed veg mixes are what it is really about  the idea is that by crushing the fruit and greens  rather than running them through a centrifugal blade  the nutrients are better preserved  though evidence for this is sketchy   still  it tastes nice  and you can buy them over here in posh health food shops and the press concession in selfridges  which now has a turnover of £15 000 a week   as davies says  “10 years ago  you would never thought that would happen unless it was coca cola”  you don’t want it instead of your lunch  but as a mid-afternoon snack  it will give you more energy than those maltesers   not so long ago  a scallop was something only hostesses in the dame barbara cartland mould would serve  it was posh  it looked faintly foreign  in la  you can barely look at a menu without seeing the quite delicious next step  the sea urchin  they are velvety in the mouth and have a briny flavour  but  admittedly  look rather like aliens  they are a good thing  though  why not make full use of the sea’s bounty  our italian cousins certainly know their worth and peter weeden  head chef at london’s newman street tavern  already has them on his menu when they are in season  coming to a m s near you soon  then  well  maybe    grand central has been in la since 1917  but it is still at the edge of inexpensive culinary advancement  alamy   i received a tip-off from this newspaper’s la correspondent that i should probably head to grand central market to try something else that is massive in la  a slightly fermented tea drink called kombucha  now  grand central may have been here since 1917  but it is no ¬geriatric  it contains  for example  the egg-based and fruitily named takeout joint  ¬eggslut  inspiration for london-based eateries bad egg  yolk london  the good eggs   it is at the bleeding  if a bit silly  edge of inexpensive culinary advancement   navigating the crowds and the neon signs that attempt to draw you in hither and thither  i see the chic  minimal bar i am after  a large  bold-type sign announces its name  better booch kombucha bar  they have six flavours of the drink  i plump for golden pear  which promises  with all the plausibility of myth  to “relax my mind and refresh my spirit”  it tastes good  similar in style to an iced tea  it would be nice on a hot day   of course  not all food trends are born equal  gourmet vegan food is a big thing here – and why not make the most out of fruit and veg and all things healthy  thing is  no matter how gourmet it is  i can’t see anyone in barnsley saying  “let’s go for a vegan” on a cold night in january  nor does elevated  artisan toast – “do you want rye  sour dough rye  or pumpernickel bread  sir ” – seem to have much prospect of success beyond the more chi-chi enclaves of east london  same goes for bulletproof coffee  a branded coffee that is served with “grass-fed unsalted butter and brain octane oil”   i find at shutters on the beach  the queen of the beach-front hotels in santa monica  the beginnings of a much finer trend  however  it is beautiful old place  shutters  perched right on the sands like some grand dame having a breather from beverly hills  in its large  airy  wood-panelled dining room  the tables are all set with bright-white plates and even brighter cutlery  staff glide around purposefully serving the guests who have tottered down from their sea-view rooms above –the la times calls them ‘divine nests’ – or escaped the tractor-beam of the pool which itself has  yes  a sea view  in the middle of the table there is a small sign  “please join us in our efforts to conserve california’s water supply”  and then  in bigger type above  “conserve water  drink wine”  whatever we think of the other trends hurtling our way  this is the sort of thing we can all get behind   the writer travelled to la with air new zealand  flights daily

the disclosure rate continues to increase  we can educate ourselves and those around us on the basics of how to respond sensitively and help break the silence around sexual assault  this week’s new york magazine surely has its most poignant cover ever  in a piece of remarkable journalism  with the caption  “the unwelcome sisterhood”  the cover shows black and white photographs of 35 of the 46 women whose sexual assault allegations against bill cosby span five decades   one of the women  barbara bowman  aged just 17 and trying to make it to the next level in her career at the time of the alleged assaults  describes the feelings about what was happening to her and the invisible bars that she felt trapped by  she said   i could have walked down any street of manhattan at any time and said  ‘i’m being raped and drugged by bill cosby ’ but who the hell would have believed me  nobody  nobody   she is  of course  correct  at that time cosby was a well-known  much-loved and respected actor  celebrated on a global scale   even today  many women are having trouble getting authorities to respond adequately to allegations of sexual violence  the guardian recently published an investigation into how university students had been let down by their institutions when trying to report their experiences of sexual assault on campus   so what is the best way to respond if someone does make a disclosure of sexual assault to you  what can you do to help and  importantly  how can you avoid making the situation worse   don’t underestimate barriers to disclosing  at durham university we have been offering training to staff about responding appropriately to disclosures of sexual violence  one of the exercises we ask participants to do is to think about the barriers that students might face when considering disclosing a sexual assault   for every concern  “will they believe me if i’ve been drinking ”  “will the forensic medical examination hurt ”  “will my parents find out ”  we place a chair in the middle of the room and line them up in a row  by the end of the exercise  participants generally move from wondering why victims don’t report to how anyone does at all   one of the ultimate fears is that they will not be believed  kay davies from rape crisis england and wales works with us on the training and always reminds us not to say  “i just can’t believe  name  would do such a thing  he’s usually such a quiet intelligent kind young man”   in this situation rather than “i just can’t believe it” being interpreted as a figure of speech  it can be interpreted as “i don’t believe you” or “no-one will believe you”  their worst fears realised in an oft-used phrase   don’t panic  it’s an awful fact that rape and other sexual assaults happen every day in every town and city  particularly though not exclusively  to women and girls  try not to look shocked and panic  realise that someone has trusted you enough to tell you about one of these daily occurrences that has happened to them   feel honoured that they came to you with this important disclosure  if they are telling you about a sexual assault that isn’t recent don’t assume they have already told other people about it even if it happened in childhood – you might still be the first person they are disclosing to   don’t ask too many ‘detail’ questions  if a disclosure is made to you and the victim intends to also make a police report  don’t delay the situation by asking too many questions  if a full disclosure is made to you  then you become an important witness and will probably need to give evidence and be cross-examined in court  this means taking notes or having a very good memory  better to leave it to the professionals and let the police take over with a properly recorded interview   even if the victim does not intend to report  you should not ask a lot of questions about the actual assault  questions such as  “what exactly happened ” or  “what did he do ” can be inappropriate depending on the context and the relationship between the victim and yourself   the language of sexual assault  “vagina”  “anus”  “semen”  “penis”  or the many slang versions of them  are not words that many people feel comfortable using out loud  especially with people they know only on a professional basis and to people their senior   don’t try to ‘fix it’  you can’t fix this – you can’t make it right and you can’t take away the pain   what you can do is respond in a caring manner  “i’m so sorry this has happened to you”  “what do you need right now ”  “is there anyone i can call for you ”  “what do you want to happen ”  don’t make promises that can’t or won’t be kept  “we’re going to make sure that bastard is found and locked up for a very long time ” try not to show your anger “i’m going to kill him when i get my hands on him”  this isn’t about you and your anger  its about what the victim needs  centre it on their needs  not yours   refer victim to the right place  the main services for victims of sexual offences are sexual assault referral centres and rape crisis centres  though both also refer to each other   sexual offence referral centres  or sarcs  take referrals  including self-referrals  from people who have recently been raped  they are usually run by the police and health services  forensic medical examinations take place at sarcs and victims can either decide to proceed with a police report while they are there – the sarc will arrange this – or the victim can choose not to make a police report but to have their evidence from the examination stored for the future  this means that if they decide they want to make a police report when they feel stronger  they have the evidence to do so   if other victims start coming forward against the same offender then the victim might feel more able to be part of a group making an allegation against the same offender than they were as a single complainant   contrary to what their name suggests  rape crisis centres do not just work with women who are in crisis  but also women who have been raped a long time – even decades – ago  many centres specialise in work with women and girls though some work with men   if someone discloses to you who does not want or need a medical examination because of the time that has passed since the assault  or they want to talk to someone in complete confidence – then this is a useful place to refer them   we cannot all become trained rape crisis counsellors  but as the disclosure rate continues to increase  we can choose to educate ourselves and those around us on the basics of how to respond sensitively   they came to you  they trusted you – please don’t let them down  help them – and us – to continue breaking the silence around sexual assault   nhs treatments such as vasectomies and hip operations to be rationed because of cost-cutting  an investigation into 19 clinical commissioning groups  ccgs  found that several

according to the health service journal  nhs england is backing the hearing aid rationing policy be deployed by north staffordshire ccg  the plans  which will affect 500 new patients each year  are

officials appreciated some patients would be concerned by the move   “but by taking responsibility for their own health  they will not only get the best possible result from their surgery  but will also reduce the risk of developing further health problems in future years ” she said   dr james kingsland  president of the national association of primary care  said that rationing “necessary care

shows 100 per cent success rate  initial results from the trial showed 100 per cent protection after 10 days  the world is for the first time on the verge of being able to protect humans against ebola  the world health organization  who  said on 31 july  as data from a trial in guinea showed a vaccine was 100 per cent effective   initial results from the trial  which tested merck and newlink genetics  vsv-zebov vaccine on some 4 000 people who had been in close contact with a confirmed ebola case  showed 100 percent protection after 10 days   the results were described as  remarkable  and  game changing  by global health specialists    we believe that the world is on the verge of an efficacious ebola vaccine   who vaccine expert marie paule kieny told reporters in a briefing from geneva   the vaccine could now be used to help end the worst recorded outbreak of ebola  which has killed more than 11 200 people in west africa since it began in december 2013   who director-general margaret chan said the results  published online in the medical journal the lancet  were an  extremely promising development     this is going to be a game changer   she told reporters   it will change the management of the current ebola outbreak and future outbreaks    this and other vaccine trials were fast-tracked with enormous international effort as researchers raced to be able to test potential therapies and vaccines while the virus was still circulating    we knew it was a race against time and that the trial had to be implemented under the most challenging circumstances   says john-arne rÃ¸ttingen  head of infectious disease control at the norwegian institute of public health and chair of the trial s steering group   ring vaccination  the guinea trial began on march 23 to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a single dose of vsv-zebov using a so-called  ring vaccination  strategy  where close contacts of a person diagnosed with ebola are immunised - either immediately  or at a later date   as data began to emerge showing the very high protection rates in those vaccinated immediately  however  researchers decided on july 26 that they would no longer use the  delayed  strategy  since it was becoming clear that making people wait involved unethical and unnecessary risk   the trial is now being continued  with all participants receiving the vaccine immediately  and will be extended to include 13- to 17-year-olds and possibly also 6- to 12-year-old children  the who said   the medical charity doctors without borders  msf   which has led the fight

innovative and pragmatic design  which allowed the team in guinea to assess this vaccine in the middle of an epidemic     our hope is that this vaccine will now help bring this epidemic to an end and be available for the inevitable future ebola epidemics   his statement said   the medical charity doctors without borders  msf   which has led the fight against ebola in west africa  is now calling for vsv-zebov to be rolled out to the other centres of the outbreak  liberia and sierra leone  where it says it could break chains of transmission and protect front-line health workers   the success of the guinea trial is a huge relief for researchers  many of whom had feared that a sharp decline in cases this year would scupper hopes of proving that a vaccine could work   another major trial in liberia  which had aimed to sign up more than 28 000 subjects  had to stop enrolling after only reaching its mid-stage target of 1 500 participants  and plans for testing in sierra leone were also scaled back   that left the study in guinea  where ebola is still infecting new victims  as the only real hope for demonstrating the efficacy of a vaccine   additional reporting by tom miles in geneva

like christmas to a sex toy brand  or  arguably something a marketing department made up  like christmas   but to celebrate  lelo have compiled some reasons why orgasms are good for us    orgasms are a natural stress relief and can relieve pain  when we orgasm the hormone oxytocin is released from nerve cells in the hypothalamus  a region of the brain  into the bloodstream and this molecule  affectionately known as the “love molecule”  helps people feel warm and fuzzy and induces feelings of optimism  increased self-esteem and trust  studies have also shown that a rise in oxytocin levels can relieve pain including from headache  cramps and overall body aches   orgasms get better with age  the lelo global sex survey shows only 4  of women are fully satisfied with their climax and only

an orgasm during intercourse  whether it’s just from having more practice and knowing your body better  or the fact that older couples are more comfortable mixing it up in the bedroom  it’s definitely something to look forward to about getting older   people who orgasm 4 or more times a week look up to 7 years younger  dr  david weeks  a british consultant clinical psychologist and former head of old age psychology at the royal edinburgh hospital  surveyed 3500 people and found those who had more orgasms looked younger  a vigorous sex life  weeks says  was the second-most important determinant of how young a person looked  only physical activity proved more important than sex in keeping aging at bay   they can help you sleep  while  anecdotally  sleepiness after orgasm is more associated with men than women  it can actually similarly affect both sexes  as stated above  our brains release a cocktail of chemicals upon climax  which include oxycotin and vasopressin  these chemicals are associated with releases of melatonin  which help regulate your sleep  and  of course  orgasms can soothe anxieties and better prepare you for a solid night’s rest   orgasms boost the immune system  according to the british medical journal  those who orgasm two times a week or more can add up to eight years on to their life  why  apparently it boosts the immune system  according to an american study of 3000 people there also seems to be a link between sexual activity and your sense of wellbeing  the study showed those who were having sex rated their general health higher than those who weren t   you can train yourself to have a better orgasm  the muscles that contract during orgasm are called pc muscles  a hammock-like structure that supports your pelvic organs  kegel exercises train this set of muscles  and offer well-known benefits such as better bladder control  however  in both men and women  performing regular kegels can increase the intensity and frequency of orgasms as well  dr ian kerner  author of she comes first says  “your intimate muscles are like any other muscle  their power and efficiency improve with a regular work out  it doesn’t need to be a long  tiring  training regimen  you can begin right now  wherever you are  just squeeze your kegel muscles for 10 seconds and release  then start again as many times as you want throughout the day ”  semen apparently has antidepressant properties…  so this one has been widely reported  unsurprisingly   but many dispute the authenticity of the research  a 2002 study from the state university of new york found that women who regularly have unprotected sex are less depressed  why might that be  well apparently semen contains a hefty cocktail of molecules including mood-elevating estrogen and oxytocin  cortisol  melatonin  anti-depressant prolactin  thyrotropin releasing hormone and serotonin  the nhs points out the study is full of holes  and we should doubt the reliability of the results  ‘if the report is taken seriously it could be seen as a green light for unsafe sex  leading to unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections – neither of which are normally associated with feeling more cheerful ” so perhaps take that one with a pinch of salt  psychological impact of nuclear disasters like fukushima more damaging than the risk from radiation  experts say  experts say that the social and psychological aftermath of a nuclear accident was too often overlooked  the long-term psychological impact of nuclear disasters like the fukushima incident can be even more damaging to public health than the immediate risk from radiation  experts have said   those living in the regions affected by nuclear accidents are more likely to suffer post-traumatic stress and depression or to feel stigmatised – problems often exacerbated by overblown estimations of the ongoing radiation risk  researchers said in a special edition of the lancet medical journal   no-one has died as a result of radiation exposure in fukushima  japan  where damage to the nuclear power plant caused by the march 2011 tsunami and the release of large amounts of radioactive material led to the mass evacuation of 170 000 people living within a 30km radius   the fukushima disaster in march 2011 released radiation into the atmosphere – even outside the food-production exclusion zone  epa   although authorities believe increased rates of thyroid cancers could be seen in the future among the most exposed children  a un report published two years after the accident stated that  otherwise  no substantial increase in future cancer rates is expected as a result of radiation   however evacuees were found to be almost five times more likely than average to have suffered psychological distress  experts writing in the special edition of the lancet  published to mark the 70th anniversary of the hiroshima and nagasaki atomic bomb attacks  said that the social and psychological aftermath of a nuclear accident was too often overlooked   among people affected by the 1986 chernobyl disaster  rates of depression and post-traumatic stress remain high  and a un assessment conducted in 2006 concluded that the incident’s effect on mental health was the most serious resulting public health issue   exposure to radiation can increase the risk of cancer throughout life  and those exposed to very high doses can suffer severe and sometimes fatal symptoms known as acute radiation syndrome  ars   at chernobyl  134 workers involved in the emergency response developed and 28 died  no such cases were reported at fukushima   in a study led by dr koichi tanigawa  of fukushima medical university  experts said that along with the immediate radiation risks  the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people created a new wave of public health impacts   “although the radiation dose to the public from fukushima was relatively low  and no discernible physical health effects are expected  psychological and social problems  largely stemming from the differences in risk perceptions  have had a devastating impact on people’s lives ” said dr tanigawa   a small number of residents have returned to their homes four years after the disaster  after the japanese government lifted restrictions on some areas around fukushima   however  there are still problems with stigma  dr tanigawa’s study reported  particularly among women from fukushima  owing to “misconceptions” about the effects of radiation on future pregnancy and children’s health   professor simon wessely  president of the royal college of psychiatrists  said that the lancet series showed that “the psychological and social consequences of nuclear accidents are more profound  long-lasting  divisive and difficult to manage than the more direct consequences of radiation leaks ”  “in future  far more attention needs to be given to community engagement and choice  and less to the extreme risk aversion which currently dominates thinking ” he said the last words of the dying are mostly about love and relationships  reveals new poll  29  of those surveyed said the deceased person had wanted them to be happy  with 17  saying they were told to live life without regret  the last words of the dying to their loved ones are most often advice about relationships  according to a new poll   the survey of 2 198 people who had lost a relative in the last year found 83 per cent had been given advice of some kind  the daily telegraph reported   relationships were the most common subject of conversation  62 per cent   following by careers  56 per cent   family  43 per cent  and education  39 per cent    twenty-nine per cent of those surveyed said the deceased person had wanted them to be happy  with 17 per cent saying they were told to live life without regret   however six per cent said they had been essentially taught a lesson and 21 per cent were told to put right past mistakes   a spokesman for perfect choice funerals  which carried out the survey  said  “many look to give some final pieces of advice to their family before they pass away and to do this because they want their loved one to be happy   “relationship advice is very common in this situation  as we have seen from our research  this is the final chance to let your loved one know what you think and many take the opportunity to share their thoughts ”five ways to boost your vitamin d levels  one in five adults and one in six children may be deficient  which can lead to osteoporosis  rickets  heart disease  cancer  multiple sclerosis and diabetes  it perhaps should come as no surprise to us that  thanks to our british weather  we are not getting enough vitamin d  a report by the scientific advisory committee on nutrition acknowledged that there are insufficient levels of uvb radiation from sunshine in the winter months to synthesise enough vitamin d in our skin  and are recommending that everyone should consider taking a supplement  one in five adults and one in six children may be deficient  according to public health england   vitamin d is essential for bone and dental health  but is also now recognised as being key to several biochemical processes in our bodies  a deficiency can be linked to  as well as osteoporosis and rickets  conditions like heart disease  cancer  multiple sclerosis and diabetes  there are also suggestions that it could be beneficial in warding off colds and fighting depression   the optimum levels of vitamin d are much debated  with some suggesting that uk guidelines are currently too low  the department of health currently recommends that pregnant and breastfeeding women  darker-skinned people and people aged 65 and over should take a daily supplement of 10 micrograms  400 international units   babies and young children aged six months to five years should be given vitamin d in the form of vitamin drops to help them meet their recommended 7-8 5 micrograms  280-340iu   some people have suggested that  for adults  an optimal dose would be 50mcg per day  although uk guidelines currently recommend that you take no more than 25mcg daily   while most other vitamins can be sourced in full from a balanced diet  it is far more difficult with vitamin d  meaning that supplementation may be a valid consideration  here are five other ways to boost your levels   sunshine  yes  rainy britain might be responsible for lack of vitamin d  but our lifestyles compound this as we spend more time indoors  exposing your forearms outdoors for 20-25 minutes can boost your vitamin d levels - even on a cloudy day  in winter  it can be difficult with fewer hours of daylight  fewer uv rays reaching us  and a tendency to cover up and stay indoors  try to get out of the office at lunchtime for a walk around the block  or encourage the children to do something outdoors every day  obviously sun safety must still be a priority  so when the sun actually does shine  and in fact  even when it doesn’t  take care to avoid sunburn and use an spf   oily fish  although it is difficult to get your daily dose of vitamin d from food alone  oily fish such as salmon  tuna and mackerel is a great source  a 3-ounce fillet of salmon can supply about 80  of your daily requirement   fortified foods  unlike in other countries  here in the uk foods such as milk  bread and grains are not routinely fortified with vitamin d  this is starting to change  though - marks   spencer has begun fortifying all its breads with the vitamin  and many spreads and breakfast cereals are also fortified   eggs  forget the egg-white omelettes - the yolk  along with having many other nutritional benefits  is a source of vitamin d  one egg contains 1mcg of vitamin d  about a tenth of the uk’s recommended dose   beef liver  it may not have been the most popular school dinner option  but  rich in protein and iron  a portion of liver also contains about 1 2mcg of vitamin d  social anxiety disorder  the thought of attending parties used to fill me with fear   it gets in the way of everyday life  but can be treated by rationalising negative thoughts which circulate through the brain  such as “they think i’m stupid” or “i’ll make a fool of myself”  three years ago i was on my way to a party  there would be drinks  music and good people  it should’ve been fun  but i didn’t feel excited  i felt sick   “what if i couldn’t think of anything interesting to say and people thought i was weird  what if i made a fool of myself ” it was freezing outside  but i was sweating buckets and my stomach tightened into knots  i couldn’t think straight   i’ve battled social anxiety disorder since the age of fifteen  the main problem was that i didn’t know what i was dealing with  and i thought i was the only one  by definition it’s “a disorder in which a person has an excessive fear of social situations ” although i personally prefer my own definition  “the idea of social gatherings or being the centre of attention makes a person feel sick with dread  convinced they’re going to make a fool of themselves  be judged negatively by others or have a massive freak out that results in a heart attack ”  the physical symptoms are the most devastating  blushing  sometimes for no reason   shaking  sweating and stuttering  to name a few  if someone merely said my name i would turn the colour of an angry tomato and not understand why   julia shearn  a british association for counselling and psychotherapy counsellor working in cardiff  said social anxiety tends to begin in childhood or teenage years but can continue into adulthood   social anxiety disorder gets in the way of everyday life   describes shearn   it is a really intense fear and it s outside the realms of what people expect from levels of anxiety    ‘shy’ and ‘quiet’  are words often used to describe those who suffer from it  but the truth is much more devastating  people who have social anxiety don’t want it anymore than someone who has flu  it’s not a choice - it just happens   after the party i knew that something had to change  i couldn’t let this control my life anymore   i went to see my local gp and to my amazement discovered that social anxiety was much more common than i thought  and more importantly it can be treated   ssris  fancy acronym for mild antidepressants  and beta blockers are generally prescribed  are there side effects  yes  are they worse than the years of misery that you’ve faced  not even close  the ssris top up the serotonin in the brain  which anxiety sufferers lack  basically  they don’t have enough neurotransmitters  which can cause problems  beta blockers reduce the physical symptoms  believe me  the luxury of not having a red face during meetings was wondrous   cbt  cognitive behavioural therapy  is also particularly effective at treating social anxiety  the basic principle is to extract and rationalise all the negative and irrational thoughts that circulate through the brain  such as “they think i’m stupid” or “i’ll make a fool of myself ” cbt can be obtained via the nhs  but there will naturally be waiting lists  charities such as anxiety uk will try and help members get cbt within a week but it can take longer  they also have a free and completely anonymous helpline   dr david carbonell  founder of the anxiety treatment centre  has one key piece of advice - be honest about your condition   the path out of social anxiety disorder is much easier when you come to see that secrecy is not your friend  others will generally be as accepting of your flaws as you are of theirs  and that when you give up your efforts to hide and oppose your visible anxiety symptoms  that s when they become less frequent and disturbing    recovery doesn’t happen overnight and like many things it requires hard work and commitment   but a few months ago  as i confidently gave a presentation in front of two hundred people - something i never thought i could do - i knew that all the effort had been worth it   when was the first traffic light installed google doodle honours 101st anniversary  the first non-electric traffic light was unveiled outside parliament  waiting at the traffic lights is probably not a highlight of your day  but the humble road solution was quite a novelty when it was first used 101 years ago   as google celebrates the occasion with a doodle on it s homepage  we chart the journey the traffic light took from blueprint to roads around the world   their dangerous cousins were first used in  london  the hand-powered predecessor to the electric traffic light was unveiled outside parliament in 1868  so pedestrians could navigate the horse-drawn traffic   invented by railway engineer jp knight  it featured moving arms  and gas-powered lamps in red and green for use at night time   however  the development of this type of traffic light slowed after it exploded in whitehall and killed a policeman   half a century later  an electric version was developed        but the inventor of the electric traffic light is disputed   some 44 years after traffic post was put up in whitehall  lester wire  a police officer in salt lake city  utah  attached wires to overhead trolley and light cables  and hung wooden box containing red and green lights from it   however  an electric red-green system installed in cleveland  ohio on 5 august  1914  is viewed as the first electric traffic signal  according to history com   it featured four pairs of red and green lights on top of a corner post  and worked via a manually operated switch inside a booth    “this system is  perhaps  destined to revolutionise the handling of traffic in congested city streets and should be seriously considered by traffic committees for general adoption ” read an article on the cleveland traffic stop published in the august 1914 edition of the motorist   it wasn’t until four years later in 1918 that the three-coloured traffic stop was put to use in new york  according to the guardian   others say inventor garrett morgan should be given credit for inventing the traffic signal  after he patented his t-shaped model in 1923 why we need prep four gay men share their views on the hiv prevention drug  in london an estimated one in eight gay men are living with the virus  a recent trial showed prep successfully reduced the risk of hiv infection by 86 per cent among participants  now  the nhs is in the process of deciding whether to make the drug available  health sector charities have issued a rallying call for the hiv prevention drug  pre-exposure prophylaxis  prep   to be made available as soon as possible to those who need it  the community statement  led by a coalition of hiv organisations  including the national aids trust  the terrence higgins trust  gmfa and the lgbt foundation  comes at a time of rising transmissions among gay men   “six thousand people were diagnosed with hiv last year  including the largest ever number of gay men ” says deborah gold  chief executive of nat  “if prep is not made available we are turning our backs on those most at risk  which would be a national disgrace  this community statement is our chance to demand access to prep as a public health imperative ”  with 3 250 gay men diagnosed in 2013  the highest figure for decades  men who have sex with men remain the most at risk to hiv infections  a quarter of those living with hiv don’t realise they have it  while in london an estimated one in eight gay men are living with the virus  with stds like gonorrhoea and syphilis registering a rise in 2014 the situation is expected to worsen   a recent live-trial  the proud study  demonstrated that prep successfully reduced the risk of hiv infection by 86 per cent among participants  although prep does not offer protection against infections such as gonorrhoea  syphilis or hepatitis  now  the nhs is in the process of deciding whether to make the drug available and if so to who   here  four gay men explain why access to prep is so essential   marc thompson  46  i m a hiv positive man  i m on treatment and i’m undetectable  so it s really unlikely i m going to pass hiv on to my partner  but relationships can be a challenge as hiv can be a big barrier between me and guys i date  sometimes sex lacks intimacy and you don t always get close to each other  there s always that fear in the back of your mind that hiv could be passed on  if we had prep it would take that fear away   as a man who s been living with hiv  prep is really important because if i m in a relationship or having sex with a man who s got a different hiv status to myself it shares the responsibility of protection  it enables us to both play a part in that   some people say that condoms are there and they re a great choice  but they haven’t stopped the epidemic  condoms can be a barrier to intimacy and they don t always work either  but if my partner is on prep then he has that piece of mind as well   there are men who have very high hiv prevention needs  men of colour  men with lower educational qualifications  younger men   they’re not always able to access condoms they re not always able to access the information that white  educated middle class gay men will have  prep gives them that additional choice  it s just about choice   i m on hiv treatment and that costs a significant amount of money  whereas prep is cheaper  so it just seems like a no-brainer  i think back to when i was diagnosed which was 30 years ago  i was a young black man so i had all of the prevention needs you can imagine  i would ve been a perfect candidate for prep if it had been available  i certainly would have taken it and it would have been one less infection   cal stroud  23  prep would allow me to have sex without fear for the first time in my life  it would no remove that month long hangover of psychological anguish after sex  worrying about whether or not i might have put myself at risk of hiv and looking for the slightest sign  if i get a cold or a rash my mind will instantly jump to conclusions because of the anxiety i have around hiv   i know it’s a completely irrational fear in many ways  even when i know there s been no risk and i know the statistics  i should feel comfort but don’t  even though i use condoms i still have anxiety  for me  wanting to use prep isn’t about not wanting to use condoms  it s about wanting to have that extra layer of security  both physically and psychologically  to not have to worry about it for the next month  which is what i tend to do   i think a huge part of it is this post-traumatic stress disorder that this entire country has been left with because of the government campaigns back in the eighties  when i came out to my parents they straight away jumped to hiv  my mum got upset because she was really worried and thought it was an inevitability and that it was something that was going to happen to me   the entire gay community is affected by this kind of anguish and it only fuels the epidemic because when people feel anxious they don t talk about it  when i try to talk about prep people make assumptions about me and try to turn the conversation into a moral debate about personal responsibility  but doing this won t stop the hiv epidemic  empowering people to take control of their hiv risk with a range of tools that is what s going to help   the thing about condom-less sex is that the expectation is not there that heterosexuals in long-term relationships are expected to wear condoms all of the time  so it s unfair to have that attitude of ‘just take personal responsibility and always wear condoms’ towards gay men  if i want to be able to let go and have completely liberated sex with a long-term partner then i deserve that   nick perry  42  i was clear in my mind that taking part in the proud study and taking prep would give me the option to not wear a condom where i routinely would  i would go to 56 dean street  a soho-based sexual health clinic  fairly regularly  not because i felt i was particularly risky but because it s good practice to do so   i don t need prep to stay alive  there are other things i can do to stop exposing myself to the same kind of risks  but the attraction of this is that it makes something fool-proof  it allows me to think protect myself when i m brushing my teeth and not whilst i m having sex   frankly  i saw it as a way of making sex less awkward  because in the real world even someone as relatively boring and sensible as me is liable to make an over optimistic judgement of the other guy and his status   so i can now be a bit more relaxed about it  it s not changed my behaviour to the point where i have started to go wild  but that particular moment in time  when you reach over and grab the packet and awkwardly fumble around with it while we all whistle a tune  i ve been able that out of the equation now and again   cost is a consideration  there is no escaping that  we don t deserve special treatment just because we re gay  we deserve special treatment  used literally  because the risk is higher   as we enter a period of time where we treat hiv more easily  i think there s an opportunity here to eradicate something that is in danger to becoming an epidemic   justin harbottle  33  i ve been working in sexual health for over five years and i’ve felt there s always been a weakness in the hiv prevention tools we have  especially for guys who have sustained difficulties around condom usage  for me  what s so powerful about prep is that it offers guys another way to protect themselves if they’re struggling with using condoms   condoms are fantastic at stopping hiv  but only if you use them  and for some people this can be really difficult  for one  you have to use them in the heat of the moment  which isn’t a state-of-mind renowned for rational decision making  especially if you’re drunk or high   and even if you have made that choice  being assertive and able negotiate it with a partner can be a big barrier  so one of the great things about prep is it allows you to make the rational health choice at a time when it might be easier and without needing your partner’s agreement   so  for those people who are most at risk of hiv and have really struggled with the main prevention tool which we ve had  suddenly you ve now got a different option for them  crucially  not only do we know that it clinically works  but after the proud trial we know that it works really well in the real world too   while condom usage remains the gold standard of hiv prevention  this shouldn’t stop us trying to understand that people might struggle with them  i think a lot of the concern around prep comes from the thought that ‘well you re taking prep to have sex without a condom’  which people see as a problem  but really i think that’s missing the point  you don’t need prep to have sex without a condom  people do this all the time  the only reason to take prep is to prevent hiv infections  and that’s a pro-health choice at its core women reclaim the word  fat  in empowering me body positive photo series  photographer mariana godoy doesn t want  fat  to be a negative word  in a world where larger women are all too often shamed for their bodies  asked prying questions about their health  and not allowed to feel beautiful  a photographer has set out to reclaim the word “fat ”  body positive images by brazilian photographer miarana godoy  22  feature women posing in their underwear  painted with slogans protesting fat shaming including  my body my rules  and  fat and healthy    other untouched photos show the volunteer models posing topless in front of dramatic graffiti art  including an illustration of artist and feminist icon frida  kahlo   godoy was inspired to create the picture series named empoderarte me  or empowering me  by a friend  and put out a call for volunteers to come forward to take part   she told mailonline that she asked the women to pose in lingerie as a  form of protest and self-acceptance  because  photographs of fat woman in lingerie are rare    the photographer went on to explain that she wanted to highlight that being fat doesn t mean a person is unhealthy  and pointed out that thinner people also experience health problems   “what people see when they think of beautiful is subjective  but i want people to see that every woman is beautiful and sensual independent of her weight ” godoy told cosmopolitan magazine    this is a fight i really want to win   she said   her photos have been picked up by international media  and have won support of women who identify with her cause   one woman wrote on her facebook group  “i m fat  and i know how hard it is   “every woman has her beauty  be it thin  fat  black or white  and you could explore this beautifully in the photographs ”  another said  “we are all beautiful no matter what form ”tea sales in decline as britons desert black tea for more exotic brews  between 2010 and 2015 the overall volume of tea sold in the uk slumped by 22 per cent  it has long been the staple beverage of british breakfast tables and is regarded by many as the national drink  but the humble cup of tea is now in serious decline as people turn to healthier herbal alternatives  according to research published on 5 august   between 2010 and 2015 the overall volume of tea sold in the uk slumped by 22 per cent  from 97 million kilograms to 76 million  the fall is “almost completely attributable to diminishing sales of ordinary teabags”  the study by global market research agency mintel concluded   sales of standard black teabags dived by 13 per cent between 2012 and 2014  but over the same period alternative teas enjoyed strong growth  green teabag sales rose by 50 per cent  fruit and herbal teabags by 31 per cent and speciality blends such as earl grey  darjeeling and assam by 15 per cent   retail analysts said the switch from ordinary tea to fruit or herbal alternatives may be partially explained by growing health awareness among the public  as the latter are not typically taken with milk and sugar  the rise of “foodie” culture may also be a factor  with regular black tea seen as unexciting compared to other blends   sales of standard black tea bags fell 13 per cent between 2012-14  emma clifford  senior food and drink analyst at mintel  said the decline may also be tied to dwindling cake and biscuit sales  “it is widely accepted that tea is a good accompaniment to biscuits and cakes  given the sugar scare  however  and that usage of such treats is in decline  these strong associations could have had a negative impact on the tea market ” she said   last month  official statistics revealed that sausages  another staple of the british breakfast table  are also falling out of favour with the public who are turning to healthier meats containing less salt and fat  according to the office for national statistics  sales of sausages have slumped by more than £2bn a year – a drop of more than a quarter since 2008   acknowledging that the “fairly mundane” image of tea was a challenge to the market  the mintel analysts suggested that manufacturers should consider introducing “extreme flavours” to make the beverage appeal to younger consumers who regarded it as dull   a woman picks tea leaves in shizuoka  japan  alternative tea sales have risen  getty   “spicy flavours such as wasabi or szechuan pepper or extreme sour flavours – as seen in the sugar confectionery market – should grab the attention of the most experimental ‘foodie’ consumers ” it said   however  the study also confirmed that tea is still a staple drink for millions of britons  more than half of the population  54 per cent  drink at least one cup of ordinary tea a day  with men aged between 16 and 44 the biggest consumers  almost three quarters typically drink it in the morning  while two thirds drink it in the afternoon   bill gorman  chairman of the tea industry body the uk tea and infusions association  said that the uk was “still a nation of tea drinkers” and that ireland was the only country in the world which consumed more per head   “the tea industry has been very slow to innovate  the coffee boys have been way ahead of us ” he said  “but now we’re producing a range of products – speciality teas  herbal fruit infusions – which is appealing to consumers  there is a shift away from the classic black blended tea onto speciality teas ”  how tea has changed  with the british desire for a cup of traditional black tea on the wane  manufacturers both large and small have been frantically developing new herbal blends and fruit infusions to keep their brands afloat  some of the new flavours play up the health benefits of drinking tea  while others appeal to audiences with more adventurous tastes or court consumers in search of a guilt-free treat   pukka herbs  the organic tea company which produces flavours such as lemon  ginger and manuka honey  “a welcoming cup of spicy-sweet organic bliss”  and supreme matcha green  “a vital wellspring of organic whole leaf green tea and the finest matcha”  launched more new products than any other tea maker last year   pg tips  one of the uk’s most popular tea brands  has also started a fruit   herbal infusions range which it expanded earlier this year to include flavours such as vibrant blackcurrant  crisp mint  zesty lemon   ginger and delicious cranberry   apple  the company now offers seven fruit and herbal teas and six green teas   twinings  another big player in the british tea market  launched a sweet green tea range last year which included a range of dessert-style flavours such as gingerbread and salted caramel  earlier this year  it added some even more peculiar infusions  including fudge melts and cherry bakewell   not to be left out  tetley launched five new green tea blends at the start of 2014  featuring fruity flavours such as mango   passionfruit and peach   apricot  in an industry first  it also launched a range of super green tea fortified with vitamins earlier this year  the berry boost flavour is described as being packed with vitamin b6 to “reduce tiredness and fatigue”  while the lemon   honey version apparently contains vitamin c to “support your immune system”  the packaging makes both flavours look like something you might find in a chemist’s cold and flu aisle three million britons working night shifts – and endangering their health  one in eight of the workforce is now employed while the rest of britain sleeps  the number of people working regular night shifts has increased to more than three million since the recession  at a potential cost to their health and family life  new research has disclosed   one in eight of the workforce is now employed while the rest of britain sleeps  with a particularly steep rise in female staff on antisocial hours   the tuc analysis follows studies suggesting a link between night-time working and increased likelihood of suffering such conditions as cancer  heart disease  diabetes  obesity and depression   it called for late-night staff to be given extra rights to protect them from exploitation which could harm their mental and physical health   more men work night shifts but women are catching up fast  the report was published ahead of a strike from this evening by london underground workers in a row over moves to an all-night tube service  the rail unions’ complaints include protests about the impact on the work life balance of their members   the tuc said the number working at night has risen from 2 961 000 in 2007 to 3 168 000 in 2014  the percentage working at night has gone up from 11 7 per cent to 12 3 per cent   it predicted the proportion would continue rising because of moves to make nhs services available seven days a week  as well as a drive to increase the availability of late-night public transport  which could in turn encourage retailers to open all hours   last year 14 9 per cent of male staff worked the night shift  compared with 9 7 per cent of female employees  but the gap between the sexes is narrowing  regular night working has increased by 12 per cent for women and by 4 per cent for men since 2007  and the two sectors with the highest percentage of night workers – care workers and nursing and midwifery – are female-dominated   a higher proportion of people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds work at night compared with the overall workforce  and young workers are far more likely to be employed at night than older colleagues   the tuc said night-time working was likely to affect employees’ social and family life  putting strain on relationships with partners and children  arguing that the impact would be mitigated if employees had more control over their hours  the tuc said no existing staff should be forced to work at night and for shift patterns to be negotiated between unions and employers   it also called for pay for night shifts to reflect the likely extra costs of childcare and inconvenience of working antisocial hours   frances o’grady  the tuc’s general secretary  said  “we all value night workers  whether they are cleaning our office  caring for a sick relative or driving all night so there are fresh goods in our local shop   tuc general secretary frances o grady  “but night work is hard and it disrupts family life  so we must show our appreciation for the sacrifices night workers make by ensuring they have rights and protections   “it is not right for employers to require night working without adequate consultation and negotiation  with night work increasing  employers must play fair and safe  or public safety will be put at risk and the families of night workers will suffer ”  she added  “we encourage the government and employers to positively engage with trade unions on fair and sensible rights for night workers  so that we continue to enjoy the social benefits night workers give us without harm to them or the public ”  a spokeswoman for the department for business  innovation and skills said  “the uk labour market allows people to get the type of work they want and businesses to structure their workforce in the way they need  flexible working is a way of finding a balance that suits both employee and employer ”  case study   i quite like night shifts   clare lynch  33  works in a brighton call centre  i’ve been working night shifts for seven years now  initially i started because i was a student and it fitted around my studies quite well  i work a shift pattern of two days on  three days off  each shift starts at 7pm and finishes at 7am   it’s not that bad working nights if you’re single  but if you’re in a relationship or have a family it can be really hard as you may only see them for a couple of hours some days   i’ve never really gotten that badly sick  stomach problems are quite common due to eating at strange hours   i actually quite like working shifts  one of the benefits of working nights is that you have more freedom compared to a 9am–5pm job  you’re left to your own devices a lot canberra couple who want to divorce are having a terrible weekend   what were you expecting   this week a couple from canberra vowed to divorce if same-sex marriage were to be legalised  they had their reasons  earlier this week the couple said  “when we signed the contract 10 years ago we made a contract with the state about what marriage is  which was husband and wife  fundamental order of creation  part of god’s intimate story for human history  man and woman for the sake of children ”  here’s what mia thought  dear bigoted couple who want to divorce to protest gay marriage…  but as it turns out  they didn’t really bother to look into the legalities of that no-doubt-very-seriously-thought-out contract they entered into   nick and sarah jensen  image via facebook   according to the abc  the family law act states that an application for divorce will only be considered if the two individuals have separated and lived separately for a continuous period of at least 12 months   so  if the couple love each other and want to keep living together  as they say  then unfortunately  they won’t be able to make their protest divorce happen   family lawyer denis farrar said  “it surprises me that any sensible person would make such a threat  because you can’t get a divorce unless you’ve been separated for 12 months ”  mr farrar  we’re not surprised  if we had to describe the jensen’s in one word  well  it wouldn’t be sensible   despite the fact that the jensen’s can’t legally do what they’ve threatened  the canberra couple is charging ahead  yes  they will continue to prove the sanctity of marriage to all of australia by vowing to throw it away willy-nilly – it’s the only reasonable thing to do   but it’s not winning them any friends  actually  it’s losing them a few   the jensen’s on the cover of canberra city news   in another not-so-surprising turn of events  a long time friend  annie haggar  has now uninvited the couple from her upcoming wedding   in a letter from ms haggar published by adelaide now she said  “i don’t want you anywhere near my wedding  you and your views are not welcome  because you’re right — the institution we’re marrying into isn’t the same one you think you’re in ”  she added  “and i’m pretty sure the consequences of your actions this week are going to mean more to you than to anyone else ”  we would have to agree  mr and ms jensen  whether you stay married or divorce is your decision – a decision you are fortunate enough to be able to make   but either way  australia isn’t listening    she was paralysed by a prank on her hen’s night  this is what she wants you to know   it was any bride-to-be’s worst nightmare   in 2010  25-year-old dance instructor rachelle friedman was celebrating her hen’s night with her closest friends  when one of them pushed her in a swimming pool as a prank   friedman fell awkwardly and hit her head on the bottom of the pool  she sustained a c6 spinal cord injury  and instantly became a quadriplegic   after the accident  rachelle wrote   in the summer of 2010  at my bachelorette party  one of my best friends playfully pushed me into a pool  my head hit the bottom of the pool  and two of my vertebra shattered  the broken vertebra damaged my spinal chord enough to leave me permanently paralyzed from the chest down   at that moment  my world fell apart  but i stayed as positive as i could be  my fiance at the time  now husband  was away on a camping trip with his family  when he heard the news  he rushed to the hospital  and never once left my side   images via facebook   despite that devastating and life-altering injury  friedman has never once let it stop her from achieving her goals   since the accident  she has married her fiancé chris  played wheelchair rugby  surfed using an adapted board  blogged for huffington post  written a best-selling book  and recently had a baby daughter via surrogacy   she has been interviewed by a range of high-profile publications and is about to feature in a documentary about her life   she recently participated in a reddit “ask me anything” session  and she impressed fellow redditors with her positivity and overall attitude to life – especially regarding her friend who pushed her that night   images via facebook   when asked by a reddit user if she was still friends with the woman who pushed her  this was her response   over the years all friendships change when you’re living far apart  but i am not angry about the push itself  it was an accident and i’ve done it a million times  i think most people can say they’ve pushed someone into a pool playfully   she also explained some of the challenges of life as a quadriplegic with a newborn   i have limited dexterity so none of it is easy  takes practice and i couldn’t really practice before i had an actual baby  doing it on a doll and a squirming baby are two completely different things  i have changed a diaper but it took me a second  i had to use my teeth to pull the tabs tight   but the best part of the reddit thread came after friedman mentioned she wanted to find a hair straightener that could be used by moving her wrist   and because the internet can sometimes be wonderful  one redditor responded by designing a prototype for a product that can help her   check out his video here and brace yourself for all of the feels   this wasn’t rachelle’s first q a session on reddit  in 2013  she answered a series of questions about her injury – including some questions about her sexlife   reddit user  do you still hold a grudge against the friend who pushed you  are you still friends with him her  what has s he said and what does s he think about your situation   rachelle  i love her and have no grudge  i’m not saying it’s right  but i’ve horse-played by a pool and pushed people  i’ve pushed her  what happened was an accident   she obviously has guilt and it has been a process  she’s a lot better  i know she hates seeing me in the chair but this is a situation we have to work through together  she’s my girl   reddit user  did you feel this way from the beginning  just after it happened  i mean  or did you have to work through feelings of anger and resentment  i’m not sure how i would feel about it  yes its an accident  but the push was not   rachelle  the push was not but i’ve done the same to her  ok  so i push her five times and we are joking around  she pushes me and on the fifth push i get hurt  so that makes her the careless evil one  i just didn’t see it that way  i was never angry at her   reddit user  how long did it take for your friends to realise that you were unable to get yourself out of the water  the other question i have is as a person who has had lifeguard training  was there someone there who knew how to properly get you out of the water   rachelle  good question because coincidentally i was a lifeguard and so were two of the girls  they responded fast but i forgot my training and said get me out of here  we had no backboard  i remember looking all around and moving my head all over the place   reddit user  what was your husband’s reaction to the fact that your relationship with him would never be the exact same  and how did it change exactly  other than the fact that he has to help you out a lot more   rachelle  well things did change but i can’t say in a bad way at all  obviously our sex life is different  there were no “logistics” before and we could be way more spontaneous   now we have sex of course  but probably less because i might be in pain or something like that  money is a factor because we were pretty even on that level before and now we rely on his teacher’s salary   so it does add stress but we work through it  i’d say we are more passionate and clingy with each other  i think we are just so happy because my injury could have been worse  we are lucky to have each other   reddit user  what is your favorite thing to do sexually before the accident and now  are you able to orgasm still   rachelle  before the accident i had sex quite often  i didn’t enjoy anything over the other i just liked having orgasms  i was a really sexual person so this has been difficult  but i am more sensitive on places like my neck and i really enjoy sex  i don’t climax like i used to but i do get excited  and oddly enough my body feels relaxed after   reddit user  how does your husband feel about having sex with a quadriplegic  was there a period of time after the accident where you abstained from sex  if so how long  when did you decide you were ready for sex again   rachelle  we didn’t have it until towards the end of rehab  mostly because we didn’t have a big enough bed or privacy   reddit user  have you discussed children with each other or with a doctor  i don’t really know much about quadriplegic pregnancies but i can’t imagine it would be easy   rachelle  yes and we want kids badly  the spinal cord controls muscles so everything else is in working order  once we get financially straight we are going to have one   my issue is i take medication for low blood pressure that i won’t be able to take  i may just be bed ridden  but that’s just me  many people with spinal cord injuries have easy pregnancies   reddit user  i was really moved by your story and your resilience of spirit  have you always been a person who was able to handle the hard stuff in life  in what ways has your abrupt physical disability changed who you are as a person   rachelle  thank you so much   it’s hard to say because i’ve never been faced with something like this but i’m just a logical person  i guess  i had a great support system and i had chris  love of my life   he deserved to have the girl he planned to marry   i don’t mean physically but emotionally  i remained my funny  joking  outgoing self for me and all those around me  i think i get a little more reserved around new people because i have no grip to shake their hand  i do appreciate life more   reddit user  there was another ama from a quadriplegic a while back that went in to agonizing detail about the nightmare that was him having no control over his bowels  is that true of you and most quadriplegics as well   rachelle  yes anyone from the waist down will most often have this problem  some paralysed people can feel but be paralyzed  so that helps  usually a suppository is used  i personally have a device to do my own digital stimulation  as long as you go on a consistent schedule you shouldn’t have accidents   reddit user  how do you feel about stem cell research   rachelle  i’m 100  for it  i was before the accident and i am after  i have a friend who traveled to israel after his accident for stem cells  he was my level of injury and got his hands back   what’s the most inspirational story you’ve ever heard  why did rachel dolezal pretend that she was african american   rachel dolezal wasn’t born into a minority  she chose to wear it as a costume   update    rachel dolezal  the civil rights activist who pretended to be african-american has announced she is stepping down as president of the naacp’s spokane chapter – the us’s oldest and largest civil rights organisation   in a message posted on the group’s facebook page  dolezal wrote that she was stepping aside after the “unexpected firestorm” that erupted over whether she misrepresented her race   she said “the dialogue has unexpectedly shifted internationally to my personal identity in the context of defining race and ethnicity ”  and that in light of that “it is with complete allegiance to the cause of racial and social justice and the naacp that i step aside ”  in her only attempt to justify pretending to be african-american she wrote   “i am consistently committed to empowering marginalized voices and believe that many individuals have been heard in the last hours and days that would not otherwise have had a platform to weigh in on this important discussion ” she wrote   previously amy stockwell wrote for mamamia    for many years  37 year old rachel dolezal has been a proud and outspoken african american woman  she is an activist  and president of her local branch of the national association for the advancement of coloured people  naacp   an organisation with a proud history of defending the rights of ethnic minorities in the united states   on her facebook page  she excitedly posted that her father  a handsome  smiling african american man  was coming to the ribbon cutting ceremony for the new naacp office   the mayor of her city appointed her to chair a police oversight committee to keep an eye on fairness in police work  when she took on that role  she identified herself has having an ethnicity that included white  black and native american  she says that she has been the victim of at least eight hate crimes threats and attacks  which she attributes to her “biracial heritage”   except she’s not   she’s not african american  not even remotely  that’s not her biological father  that’s not her natural hair  that’s not her history   her biological parents have come forward with evidence that she is of european descent  mr and mrs dolezal said their daughter had black siblings who were adopted and that she went to school in mississippi  where the family were part of a mainly black community  but they said she only began to say that she had african descent after divorcing her african american husband  whom she had married in 2004   her mother  ruthanne  said rachel began to “disguise herself” in 2006 or 2007  the couple told the washington post  “there seems to be some question of how rachel is representing her identity and ethnicity  we are definitely her birth parents  we are both of caucasian and european descent — czech  german and a few other things ”  it’s not clear exactly how rachel dolezal benefited from her masquerade  she was apparently paid for lectures she gave about her black identity  she is adjunct professor of africana studies at eastern washington university  she has certainly been appointed to at least one government body as a representative of ethnic minorities in her area   more disturbing is her parents’ suggestion that she received a full scholarship to a prestigious american university  which has a predominately black student population and faculty  because they believed her to an african american woman  her parents say that when rachel applied to howard university to study art with a portfolio of “exclusively african american portraiture ” the university “took her for a black woman” and gave her a full scholarship   “you’ve got a white woman coming in that got a full-ride scholarship to the black harvard ” lawrence dolezal said  “and ever since then she’s been involved in social justice advocacy for african americans  she assimilated into that culture so strongly that that’s where she transferred her identity ” he added  “but unfortunately  she is not ethnically by birth african american  she is our daughter by birth  and that’s the way it is ”  now the fact that dolezal is a white woman doesn’t mean she can’t be an advocate for social justice or lead the charge to stamp out police brutality against black people  it doesn’t mean she can’t be a powerful ally in that fight  but it does make her a fraud   when asked on camera whether her parents were white  rachel said  “i don’t understand the question”   when she was reached for comment by the spokesman-review  she answered by saying  “that question is not as easy as it seems…there’s a lot of complexities…and i don’t know that everyone would understand that…we’re all from the african continent”   we’re all from the african continent  that was her defence for masquerading for years as a woman of colour  we all walked out of africa 1 8 million years ago   rachel’s panicked reaction to being asked about her white parents is here  post continues after the video   no doubt there will be a lot of discussion over the next few days about the appropriation of black culture and history  she is not the first  and she won’t be the last  there is also an important discussion to be had about whether ethnicity can ever be cultural when it isn’t biological  there are many debates that should be had here  a lot of people are angry  and not without cause   but perhaps the most fascinating question here is  what makes a person do this   rachel dolezal wrote on her facebook page about the experience of watching the film ’12 years a slave’ as a black woman living in ‘whitopia  aka idaho eastern washington ’  what is extraordinary here is that a woman  with access to every privilege that comes with being white in this world has decided to play at being a black woman  she wanted to be in a minority  no matter what the people who spend every day living as part of that minority actually face   she wanted to pretend to be someone who experiences higher rates of domestic violence  and higher rates of incarceration   she wanted to dress up as someone who is paid less  and discriminated against more   she wanted to disguise herself as someone who can expect worse health outcomes and poor representation at every level of business  government and community structures   this may be a case of a casual lie that got out of control  it may be that rachel has a psychological condition  she might have some damage from her past that is playing out here  she might just be a liar  people lie about their history all of the time  but there is something particularly reprehensible about people who lie to obtain some glory from a fictional disadvantage while hiding their privilege   consider the cancer-fakers  the belle gibsons of the world  who are desperate to hide the fact that they are healthy  they want to tell a powerful story of struggle against the odds  they want to be different  special  unique  but they want all of that without the pain  without the suffering and the devastation  they want it all without the risk  think also of the music artists who pretend to have been in prison  reporters who bolster their credibility by saying that they were almost killed in war zones  authors who claim that they or their families have been the victims of historical atrocities like the holocaust   belle gibson  brian williams and helen darville  all caught out for stealing a reality that wasn’t their own   these people want to steal the silver lining  without ever being in the cloud – except there’s something very perverse about seeing a silver lining in someone else’s suffering  there is an absence of empathy in taking that suffering and wearing it as a coat that keeps you feeling warm and special  when people who have actually lived that experience feel anything but   rachel dolezal has stolen an identity  she has stolen a history  in doing so  she has cherry-picked the parts she liked about being in a minority  without any of the disadvantages  prejudice or discrimination   rachel dolezal wasn’t born into a minority  she chose to wear it as a costume – but now that mask has been torn away  she is left to ponder the same big question that everyone has  why   the naacp has today released a statement about rachel dolezal  who was their branch president in washington   for 106 years  the national association for the advancement of colored people has held a long and proud tradition of receiving support from people of all faiths  races  colors and creeds  naacp spokane washington branch president rachel dolezal is enduring a legal issue with her family  and we respect her privacy in this matter  one’s racial identity is not a qualifying criteria or disqualifying standard for naacp leadership   the naacp alaska-oregon-washington state conference stands behind ms  dolezal’s advocacy record  in every corner of this country  the naacp remains committed to securing political  educational  and economic justice for all people  and we encourage americans of all stripes to become members and serve as leaders in our organization   hate language sent through mail and social media along with credible threats continue to be a serious issue for our units in the pacific northwest and across the nation  we take all threats seriously and encourage the fbi and the department of justice to fully investigate each occurrence “i gave up a six figure salary for my husband ”  i made my husband’s dreams possible   his ability to “have it all” is built on the back of my sacrifice  we chose to move to a place that allowed his career to blossom and mine to stagnate  we chose to have a family  a decision that ended up impeding my ability to find a job  we chose these things together  but they did not come without a cost… one that was paid mostly by me   before anyone passes me a tissue or lights a torch in my honour  i want to point out that i am not a martyr  i didn’t spend those “investment” years crying in a corner or suffering in silence  i got to live abroad  which had always been a dream of my own  i took advantage of the luxury of financial stability and very affordable childcare to explore some smaller dreams — running my own business  without needing to make a profit   getting to know my children  creating my blog and writing for fun  none of these things would have been possible had i stayed on my 60 hour-a-week  fast-tracked career path i’d been on before we settled down   “his ability to ‘have it all’ is built on the back of my sacrifice ”  image  facebook- the nomad mom diary   but as much as i can play around with imaginary numbers and try and put a price tag on my experience as a sacrificing spouse  the actual losses from four years of virtually no salary cannot be overlooked  over half a million dollars in earnings — not potential earnings  but the real  total of four years of paychecks at my pre-baby salary — this is the true cost to me  and to our family  for putting my husband’s career dreams at the top of our list  four years of bonus checks i would have otherwise received and stocked away in my bank account to spend however i wanted   when the topic of the wife bonus topic came up recently  as distasteful as the word is to many  i couldn’t help feeling a little bit of camaraderie with those women  especially the one who wrote this article  just like me  that woman walked away from a well-paid gig when her husband got a great job offer  now i would never call my husband my boss  not even while under an anesthetic   but i would absolutely agree with her that i earned some chunk of my husband’s bonus check   “splitting the household chores and child-related responsibilities are all part of the day-to-day task we opt into when we get married and have kids ”  why bonus check and not regular paycheck  in our case  the regular paycheck went into covering all of the regular things — mortgage payments  food  clothing  childcare — and a little slush fund for savings  but the bonus — the one time of year when his employer said  “hey  thanks for going above and beyond  for giving us 110  this year and doing more than the job description required  here’s a little extra money for you to spend as you see fit ” — i don’t see any reason why i shouldn’t be given equal consideration  splitting the household chores and child-related responsibilities are all part of the day-to-day task we opt into when we get married and have kids  but big sacrifices like the ones i made — giving up a career and a fat paycheck of my own — well  those deserve a little extra recognition  calling it a bonus and making it clear that it is mine further underscores my right to spend it as i see fit   in our case  the regular paycheck went into covering all of the regular things — mortgage payments  food  clothing  childcare — and a little slush fund for savings ” image  facebook- the nomad mom diary  how much money i got in a bonus and how i spent it is nobody’s business but my own  and if you don’t think that my sacrifices earned me that money

story of rachel  played savagely by blazey best  a downtrodden mousy woman in a violent marriage who escapes into her alter-ego  clifford north  played with buckets of swagger by iota   “craig came up with the idea ” says iota   “it’s the story of a girl in an abusive relationship who escapes into a fantasy world of glam rock  i thought about it for five seconds and then said let’s do it  we’re both pretty sensitive guys and we can put ourselves in situations like that  we certainly came at it with empathy and compassion ”  iota to the right  image supplied   i found it unsual that rachel’s

julia roberts attempted to shake up our beauty standards back in 1999 when she appeared at the premiere of notting hill in a frisky pink mini dress with some cheeky armpit hair poking out of the short sleeves  she claimed she’d simply forgotten   the world found this hard to believe but somehow it kept turning  things went quiet on the armpit front until this year when some very cool girls began to grow out their pits  first  girls actress jemima kirke   jemima kirke keeps her underarms natural  as she showed at the cfda awards in new york  image via snapchat   next  miley cyrus who took things even further by dying her armpit hair   miley  with pink pits   and now  the biggest country in the world has begun a national conversation about hairy armpits   for the past two years  thousands of chinese women have been posting their armpit selfies on a chinese twitter  weibo  to highlight women’s equality  well-known chinese women’s rights activist  xiao meili  launched the idea behind the competition  trying to discourage females from buying into female stereotypes  including shaving their armpits  she said  “girls are often anxious about their armpit hair as if it’s a sign of being dirty or uncivilized… but we should have the freedom to choose whether to accept what grows naturally on our bodies ”  for this this year’s competition  the winner was given 100 free condoms and was awarded to zhu xixi  with this spectacular image   “for the past two years  thousands of chinese women have been posting their armpit selfies on a chinese twitter  weibo  to highlight women’s equality ”  second place was awarded a vibrator  and third 10 female urination devices   xiao also says that shaving underarm hair was started as a western tradition  and it wasn’t until the 1990s did chinese females start to do the same  she blames the media from propagating this standard of beauty  in order for commercial success selling shaving cream and razors  the activist also explains that we consider underarm hair to be “ugly” when it can actually be ” adorable  interesting  humorous  sexy  serious  connotative and ever-changing ”  did you want to see some of the glorious entries   post

bbc   “i think this competition is very meaningful… we need some space to think about why women are obliged to shave ourselves  “for women  we need to free our minds and our bodies  for me  my body is my battlefield ”  when i was 20 years old  i seriously considered growing my armpit hair  i was living in italy at the time and it was summer  one day  at the local public pool  i noticed how all the women around me – women who had very high standards of personal grooming – had hair growing under their arms   and i’ve got to say  they looked kind of hot  earthy and sexy and natural and just hot   “when i was 20 years old  i seriously considered growing my armpit hair ” image via getty   i had an immediate inner argument with myself because i had always been horrified by armpit hair on women   and being a child of the 70s  i’d seen my fair share of this in my own home  my mother had hairy armpits until i was about 13 or 14   don’t even get me started on the trauma of walking out of the school gate with your friends to have your mother call your name from across the street wearing a single top while frantically waving to get your attention  her armpit hairs wafting free in the

armpits  she never stopped shaving her legs  and what made her start again a few years after i became a teenager   i never did grow out my armpit hair  i continued to shave and then laser and now i barely need to do anything  my mum remains underarm hair free and wants you to know that it’s a myth that it’s more smelly   what do you think of growing back armpit hair  will you join in the most unrealistic thing about jurassic world isn’t the dinosaurs   realism in movies is over-rated   there are few more irritating film companions than the one who sits beside you snorting  “as if ”  my life is real enough  i’m sure yours is  too  let’s keep cinema for what it was designed for  eating calorific food in the dark while enjoying surround-sound loud enough to prevent conversation   but  but  but…  there’s something we have to discuss  we just do  and it’s about the only movie you went to see this weekend  in fact  judging by the box office figures  the only movie anyone has been to see in an actual  you know  cinema for months   jurassic world  you know  this one   maybe we’re all rushing to see it through a sense of nostalgia… remember the first time the dinosaurs came back and started eating people  wasn’t that cute   or maybe the population has just discovered an overwhelming need to see chris pratt whispering sweet nothings into the ears of carnivorous lizards   whatever  we all went to see jurassic world this weekend   and wow  the dinosaurs were loud  and big and scary  and the 3d was suitably disorientating  and the bit-players got munched with satisfying regularity  and a good time was had by all   but the shoes  the shoes   this is bryce dallas howard  you have seen her before  maybe in twilight  excuse me  eclipse   maybe in lady in the water… okay  you haven’t seen her before  but anyway  here she is   bryce dallas howard  image via tumblr  she plays the female lead in jurassic world  let’s call her claire  because that’s what she’s called    she’s one of those “uptight career women” who inhabit movie land  she works for the big  bad dinosaur company  and is excellent at her job  she’s been so very busy with all that working  she’s lost track of the stuff that makes a woman a woman  like remembering how old your nephews are   but in case we are in any way confused about this person’s gender  we are given some handy clues   high heels   see them  image via tumblr  of course high-flying  corporate claire would wear high-heels  click-clacking around her space-age dinosaur lab swiping things and pointing at screens and saying things like  “there’s a security breach in paddock 134    but when  spoiler alert  the dinosaurs escape and start eating people  claire has to do a lot of running  so much running  in fact  that her “selfish” little career woman life depends on it  that and her ability to keep up with chris pratt  who runs very fast for a human in an indiana jones outfit who seems to be built of mostly muscle and cheesy one-liners   image via tumblr   and that was it  my disdain for realism was forgotten and i spent the rest of the movie thinking only these things   1  take your shoes off   2  take your shoes off   3  for the love of all that is holy  take those fucking shoes off   look  i know  i know  if i follow myself down that rabbit hole of realism  charging around the jungle bare-foot also has its downsides  bindis  people  and discarded t-rex teeth   but believe me  there were corpses littering this theme park that were just asking to be stripped of their footwear  and any woman who has stood too long in a toilet queue at a wedding will tell you  an ill-fitting stinky work boot is a better option than a spike heel when you need to get shit done   even chris pratt realises how stupid this looks   so why did claire have to wear heels throughout jurassic world  while i can only imagine the conversations that went on in the writing rooms about wardrobe  i’m certain that they were going for an old-hollywood  king-kong-esque glamour that riffs on action movies of times gone by  you know  something like this…  but  in those times gone by  not all disaster-movie leads were made to hobble about in heels   like in  say  the original jurassic park  twenty-two years ago  when the dinosaurs first escaped  laura dern was the one doing the running and the screaming  and she was allowed to wear flats   now that’s an appropriate shoe  image via tumblr  please  in the name of oh s  can we not return to a simpler time when a woman could run away from a monster in comfort   have we made no progress  people  no progress at all   i need a lie down in a dark room  one without dinosaurs   so  would you have ditched the heels and robbed a corpse for some sensible shoes the only 7 apps that

oprah winfrey’s hair   even the queen of talk-shows is capable of making poor choices…  oprah was queen of television from 1986-2011   and on top of her queen head  sat an impressive crown of ever-evolving hair   first  she was fuzzy   gale told her she looked like she’d stuck her finger in a socket   in 1988 she had a french roll  in 1995  she cut her hair into a sleek bob  and it became a front-page news story   but we barely remember her like this  in 1997   she briefly tried the long locks when madonna appeared on the show and encouraged her to mix things up a bit  it’s a wig    oprah looks back on her hairstyles with a sense of humour  best of all  she looks at the bad choices and wonders  why didn’t someone tell me   we hear you  oprah  we hear you what do you do when your parents start following you on social media   remember 2009  it was a freer time then   for a while there  the internet was a parent-free zone  a glorious escape from your progenitors’ snooping eyes   but no more  facebook is now supremely uncool  which means everyone’s on it  including your mum  dad and aunt maureen  and they’re watching your every move   the thing is  baby boomers are new to this internets business  they didn’t grow up with an innate sense of what’s acceptable online behaviour   unfortunately  no one’s parents are allergic to facebook anymore   just a few short years ago  my parents were still blissfully ignorant of social media  lacking the wherewithal to navigate its various platforms   i could tag myself in photographs that suggested budding alcoholism and poor decision-making  and swear with impunity   that all ended when my mother and stepfather joined facebook with a joint account  parents like to navigate the internet together  one hand each on the mouse    i am the first to admit i handled it badly  things were said that couldn’t be taken back  there was radio silence on facebook  until i was desperate  just desperate  to see an obscure dad-joke on a picture of me posted by a friend they didn’t know   this is the kind of thing that can happen when your parents get online   eventually  we made it up  but i learned an important lesson  the internet is a place we now share with our parents  so we need to learn to get along   here are my tips for having a harmonious online relationship with your parents   1  censor your profile   fact is  you don’t really want anyone to see that picture of you several margaritas deep and doing the single ladies dance  it wasn’t your finest moment  you are not beyonce   and no one thinks putting your middle finger up is clever  young lady   2  educate and lead by example   communicating on social media is like a whole different language  older people who are new to it are often unaware of what’s appropriate   i mean  they’re all over lol  and my mum’s favourite omg  which she actually says out loud now  “oh em gee ”   but they might not realise that sending incessant candy crush requests is obnoxious  or that having an endorsement from your mum on linkedin is unlikely to score you a job   just sit ’em down and explain it  don’t be patronising – they didn’t belittle you when you didn’t know how to ride your bike yet   there has been a spate of incidences of grandmas tagging themselves as grandmaster flash  it’s so cute i can’t stand it   3  be understanding   yes  fine  maybe your dad did just discover keyboard cat  rest in peace  you little treasure  and keeps sending you gifs of the star wars kid  but remember when you saw those magical memes for the first time   remember how tickled you were by the honey badger that didn’t give a fuck  and the life-changing first time you encountered grumpy cat   cut them some slack   be prepared for them to take the piss out of you in front of all your friends   4  don’t act like a bitchy teenager   “don’t talk to my friends  oh my god  you’re sooooooo embarrassing           ”  sound familiar   you can’t digitally throw a tanty  and while it’s excruciating to read your dad’s six comments on your friend’s status update  don’t be a jerk about it  he’s still learning  plus  your friends probably love your dad  he’s adorable   4  divert the attention onto a sibling   chances are  you can distract a parent who’s in the middle of trawling through all your photos videos posts tweets and commenting on each and every one  “your hair looks nice here ” “is that a cigarette ”  by implicating a sibling   “hey mum  look at this picture of nick driving without a seat belt on ”  bam  thank me later  a glass of pinot should cover it   5  block their updates   does your dad post constant updates on the cricket  terrible  terrible jokes  block his updates  he’ll never know   6  extreme solution  create two accounts  if you don’t want to clean up your act but you can’t not accept your parents’ friend requests  this is the only way  have one nsfp  not safe for parents  account  and one family-friendly account   you’ll have to live a complicated double-life  weaving a web of deceit that will likely be unravelled at some point in the future  but for a while  you’ll be living the dream   my parents totally get it now  send me cat pictures with the promise of presents and you’ll have no problem at all   so there you have it  tips for avoiding a family rift because of social media  my mum and stepdad and i are on great social media terms now  i cut them a bit of slack  and they understand the dos and don’ts  mostly   there’s a new problem  though  my dad’s just joined facebook  he’s listed as his occupation “philanthropist”  he’s on the pension   he’s got a lot of free time   wish me luck “i have one big problem with gabi and geoff splicing their dna ”  gabi grecko and geoffrey edelsten are having a baby  so celebrating   we know because last night gabi put a picture of her positive pregnancy test on instagram  we know because she told breakfast radio this morning that she is “three or four weeks” into her pregnancy   gabi said to the daily mail  “my gyno  gynecologist  called and left messages  on saturday  and said  “you’re pregnant ” i then took another test for myself”  because  you know  gynos can be unreliable  so it’s always best to check a medical opinion with a test you bought at the supermarket   in truth  she wanted the test because it makes a killer instagram pic  gabi knows her brand   the couple say the baby is a huge shock  but who knows  in one breath  gabi says that the baby was a surprise  in the next  she says that she wasn’t using any form of contraception and they were trying for a baby   it’s not really worth trying to trace the truth here  the story shifts with these guys  it always does  they tell tales  even the story of how they met is contested – she says they met at a fashion show  he says they met on the street  and they court public attention  he proposed at the melbourne cup in a canary yellow suit with tabloid cameras that just happened to be perfectly positioned   so they tell little lies  that’s their thing  they love attention  they love to shock  big deal  everyone in australia could do that if they wanted to   this is what gabi and geoff’s baby is going to look like  according to makemebabies com  you’re welcome    but there’s something that grates about this particular announcement  something that just doesn’t sit right  something wrong  even   gabi said to fairfax media this morning  “me and geoff are so happy we feel so blessed he told me before we were even engaged that i was the only woman he’d had ever wanted children with  he cried when we found out ”  so  gabi is the only woman geoff had ever wanted children with  that’s sweet   except   except when you remember that geoffrey edelsten already has a son  his name is matthew and he is 26  the same age as gabi  geoffrey and matthew don’t really speak  though gabi is keen to help the pair reunite  gabi told the daily mail last november that she felt like she could help bring matthew and geoffrey closer together because she and matthew are close in age and she’d be able to relate to him   i’m going to go ahead and suggest that matthew isn’t going to be too thrilled to hear that gabi is the only woman who geoff ever wanted to have a baby with  that might make matthew feel a bit shit  despite how close he and gabi are in age  gabi and geoff don’t seem that thoughtful and self-aware  they don’t necessarily think through the consequences of their actions  they live large  that’s who they are   but  geoffrey and gabi are having a baby  they are bringing another person into their world – a world of shifting truths and exposure  a world where mum announced she was breaking up with dad on instagram three days after becoming engaged  a world where dad keeps mum’s engagement ring for safe keeping  presumably because he doesn’t trust her with it  a world where mum nudes up in public and dad gropes at mum’s boobs on the internet  a world where mum and dad are focussed on the next way they can shock australia   hey  hey  geoffrey and gabi are having a baby   flick through the gallery below for more photos of geoffrey and gabi   post continues after gallery…   sure  australia rolls its collective eyeballs but we’re down with it  because we’re pretty laid back  they’re over-exposed liars who love to shock  but they’re entitled to their happiness  they can have a baby if they want  they can bring a baby into that whacky scenario  cool  whatever  each to their own   except   except there are couples in australia who want to have a baby where everyone doesn’t say  cool  whatever  good for them   except there are couples in australia who would make wonderful parents  and provide loving stable homes  but the law says  sorry  that’s not ok   except there are couples in australia who would love to raise their children freely  but must protect their children from a loud minority of people who think that they’re not fit to be raising children at all  being obnoxious  thoughtless and false isn’t their thing  but they are going to face discrimination that gabi and geoff couldn’t even imagine   in four australian states  south australia  queensland  victoria and the northern territory   same sex couples are banned from adopting children  in those jurisdictions  only heterosexual couples who are married or in de facto relationships can adopt   in south australia  lesbian couples who are fertile are prevented from accessing ivf  those who wish to do so must travel interstate for treatment   south australia and western australia also ban altruistic surrogacy for same-sex couples   that’s all before you get to the prejudice and discrimination faced by same sex families who wish to raise children   so excuse me when i am not enthusiastic about gabi and geoffrey splicing their dna and bringing a child into their circus  it seems like a hollow mockery that they can do it  while our laws deny so many other couples that chance   as you watch this whole new chapter in the gabi and geoffrey melodrama unfold  ask yourself this  why this couple and not others  why is this relationship right for bringing children into and a same sex family isn’t  a couple who lives to shock is better than a couple who lives to nurture   face it  australia  you think gabi and geoffrey make good parents  and that the most shocking thing of all   are you happy for geoff and gabi penny lancaster says cooking robs men of their masculinity   it sounds like rocking rod is off the hook for kitchen duties forever   penny lancaster – wife of raspy-voiced rocker rod stewart – reckons men should leave cooking to women because hacking and heating a dead beast is not sufficiently manly   the 44-year-old mother of two acknowledges that her views may be “a bit old-fashioned”  you think   but the male species should be “the hunter-gatherer  the macho man  looking after the family”  just not by feeding them    “i do agree with equal rights and if women want to go and work that’s fabulous ” she told the telegraph   rod stewart won’t have to cook any time soon  thanks to his wife penny lancaster  image via twitter   lancaster is married to a man who croons love songs for a living  but says cooking deprives men of their manhood   “if anything  when men come home i think it’s more a case of being part of the family  spending more time with the children  being a strong role model   but going as far as cooking and putting the apron on  i think that it  not belittles men  but takes the masculinity and i would miss that   we’re different… men are from mars and women are from venus  testosterone  oestrogen – we’re different creatures  i think you’ve got to let men do it their way ”  so  the take-away message here is women should cook  because hormones  and planets   as someone who is constantly trying to ensure that cooking duties in our home are evenly split  reading this today made me cry a little inside   my husband and i are dinks – dual income  no kids – so there are no helpless and hungry mouths to be fed  apart from our dog’s  and even that responsibility is shared    we both work full-time  so our unspoken agreement is that whoever is home first will start cooking dinner   but according to lancaster  i should be working full-time and then cooking dinner each night  lest my poor husband be robbed of his masculinity by the simple act of putting on an apron   rod is used to ordering food at fancy french restaurants  image via twitter   that’s not going to happen  because my lovely husband is an adult   so ensuring food makes its way to his stomach is his responsibility  not mine   sorry  penny  but you are so wrong   men cooking is far from emasculating   it’s sexy  there is nothing better than that early stage in a relationship when each person cooks for the other  each trying to impress with their culinary prowess  even if it only extends to one dish   having someone  anyone  take the time to prepare a home-cooked meal for you is one of life’s simple pleasures   it’s empowering  lancaster obviously hasn’t been between an aussie man and his bbq  the sacred place for pondering life over a snag and vb  to complete the stereotype   having a secret cooking power that brings the boys to the yard  or people to the table  is a point of pride   nobody tell gordon ramsay he is a pansy  image via twitter   it’s equality  it’s about sharing the load  if a woman chooses to take on the sole responsibility of cooking because she wants to  good on her  but there should not be a blanket expectation that women will prepare and cook every meal   it’s survival  options include eating raw food  frozen meals  take away  cooking or starvation   men are cooking more now than ever  thanks to popular cooking shows on tv and celebrity chefs  the vast majority of which are male   i know plenty of homes in which the man routinely cooks because his partner has no interest in it    realmencook  image via twitter   as mundane as putting together a weeknight dinner in little time and with many distractions can be  lots of people enjoy cooking generally – regardless of their gender   despite lancaster’s comments  she certainly doesn’t spend all her time in the kitchen   she has previously spoken about the family’s “wonderful chef”  though she says she likes to go to the supermarket “to stay connected to reality”   i think it might be time for a quick trip to tesco   cooking is many things  emasculating is not one of them   who cooks in your house road to refuge coffee cups are being rolled out across melbourne cafes for refugee week   to celebrate refugee week  more than 30 melbourne cafes are stocking road to refuge stamped coffee cups to encourage customers to reflect on refugees and australia’s relationship with them  and there’s no better time to catch a someone than when they’re having a quick coffee   this week almost 40 000 takeaway coffees will walk out of cafes across melbourne with an image of ten-year-old layla — an asylum seeker from tehran and one of the road to refuge journey characters — stamped on the cup   the road to refuge web program is an educational and interactive website that allows you to make choices for a fictional asylum seeker along their journey from country of origin to australia  you can check it out here  in one of the journeys  layla faces her family’s terrifying decision of whether to flee home or not and to make a dangerous journey in search of protection  while layla’s character is fictional  the journey of many asylum seekers in her position is not  for this reason  coffee drinkers are invited to visit the road to refuge website and complete the interactive journey of an asylum seeker in their choose-your-own-adventure program   meet layla   founder and director of the organisation  dana affleck  explained that the initiative provides “a non-invasive way to bring refugees into the hands and minds of regular latte-drinking melburnians”    it allows customers to engage as much or as little as they wish in this conversation  but at the very least  we hope it will plant an important seed ” she said   dana busily stamping coffee cups   road to refuge also runs regular events  school workshops in metro and regional areas  adult education initiatives and even have their very own coffee cart  which will make two appearances this weekend     discussing asylum seekers is often believed to be a taboo subject but road to refuge aims to take the edge off and bring this important issue into mainstream conversation through its accessible and dynamic approach to community engagement   “we hope that this coffee cup project will encourage people to think about an issue they may not otherwise engage in ” affleck said   “we are proud and excited to be partnering with some of the best cafes in melbourne to spread the word   “and what better time to take a moment to consider something different then over a morning coffee fix or lazy afternoon pick-me-up ”  oof  time for an afternoon coffee i think   from auction rooms  in north melbourne  cru in kew and small

list struggling with rent or hideous housemates here’s a solution you’ve probably never thought of   is this the solution joe hockey has been looking for   one saturday afternoon i was busy unpacking boxes in my new flat when there was a knock at my door   it was a woman telling me her great aunt  who i had just moved in with two days ago  had had a bad fall and was at the local hospital  i needed to pack her a bag and get there right away   shit  i thought  what do i pack an old lady who i’ve known for less than 48 hours  oh god… do i have to go through her undies drawer    author harriet farkash  image  supplied   i walked out of my little flat  across the garden and let myself into her house through the back door  i rifled through her drawers  feeling a bit like a sicko prowler  trying to think what she would want  pyjamas  toothbrush  a book  hand cream  old ladies like hand cream  don’t they   as i made my way to the hospital  to be by the bedside of a woman i had only had a cup of tea with  i wondered what the devil i’d gotten myself into…  you see  a few months earlier i had answered an ad looking for someone to live in a small granny flat  rent and bill free  in exchange for 10 hours of ‘light duties’ a week   the night harriet moved in  image  supplied   anyone who forgoes  15 salads for lunch in sydney in order to make rent  knows just how attractive an offer like this is  add to the fact the house was located in one of sydney’s most exclusive suburbs  and i had pretty much alerted hr of my change of address even before i was interviewed   when i met lol  aka little old lady  as she became known   we instantly clicked  despite the fact i don’t have grandparents so my experience with pensioners was limited to the three episodes of golden girls i’d seen   mentally  she was totally with it  but she had a problem with her leg and couldn’t walk easily without the help of a stick  which made doing some things a bit tricky   that was where i came in   i was to look after the cleaning of the kitchen  she had a proper cleaner come once a fortnight though  take her grocery shopping  and take her for a walk around the local shops from 8 – 8 30 every morning   this circuit was only about 700 metres but it took us the full half hour  we would look in shop windows  sometimes stop by the bakery to get her a treat  and occasionally i’d give the finger to the peak hour drivers honking us when we shuffled across the road at the pace you would expect from an old lady with a bung hip   not that she ever saw me do that  she would have been horrified    harriet’s morning walk outlook  image  supplied   after a few months of walking together every morning  she became my most unlikely friend and ally  she helped me with work problems  gave wise life advice  and sided with me on how ridiculous men in sydney are when it comes to dating   “in my day  we were courted properly  none of this tinder business  i don’t know what it is  but i don’t like it ”   and i think she liked having me around to keep her walking  keep her thinking and keep her au fait with what was going on with young people – although a lot of it she couldn’t understand   “why do young women these days wear such ghastly pants  your crotch should not be at the same level as your knees ”   sure  living there did inhibit my lifestyle slightly  you try nonchalantly telling a guy you’ve just met at the bar that you live with an 80 year old  and my boyfriend at the time only stayed over once  not because lol would’ve cared – in fact  she wouldn’t have known given my little flat had it’s own lane way entrance – but it’s just a bit awks getting busy with a grandma a few yards away watching downton abby   then there’s the fact the responsibility i felt to ensure she was ok weighed on me  seeing her in hospital that first day was a wake up call that something so innocuous like a small trip on the stairs could  unlike most flatmate situations  potentially end disastrously   despite that though  living with lol was the absolute best and something i recommend to anyone struggling with rent or hideous flatmates   “you try nonchalantly telling a guy you’ve just met at the bar that you live with an 80 year old ” image  supplied   sharing a ramshackle townhouse with my friends in my early 20s was epically fun  but in many ways  lol was the perfect flatty  she never experimented with anything harder than panadol rapid  didn’t like heavy metal  never took my beloved alice mccall dress without asking and – surprisingly  given our 50 plus year age difference – was a real good laugh  like that time she called me in a tizzy because her email refused to send even though she had written her physical address in the address bar   after a year there  it was time to pack up and leave  i had saved enough money for a deposit on my own apartment and was ready to move in  someone alert joe hockey’s team about this alternate option to getting a new job to solve the housing crisis    but still  to this day  i miss lol  and i’m forever grateful for the unique circumstances  which helped two people to become unlikely flatmates  and even more unlikely friends they tell us “mattress girl” has made a sex tape  it’s much bigger than that   what she has done is much  much more interesting   trigger warning  this post includes nudity and deals with issues of rape and sexual assault and may be triggering for survivors of abuse   “mattress girl makes sex tape” is a pretty alluring headline   because the american media  in particular  can’t get enough of emma sulkowicz  the us university student known for protesting her alleged college rape by carrying a mattress around the campus of columbia university  for months   and yes  part of the ‘sex tape’ headline is true  she has released a very graphic video of herself engaging in what begins as apparently consensual sexual intercourse   and then the sex abruptly turns violent   the eight-minute film is titled ‘ceci n’est pas un viol’   this is not a rape  and depicts sulkowicz and an anonymous male actor entering a dorm room  stripping off and engaging in sex  before the male actor suddenly slaps sulkowicz and begins strangling her  a distressed sulkowicz can be heard saying ‘no’ and ‘stop’ while the man removes his condom and continues to penetrate her as she whimpers in pain  the footage is deliberately shot as though from four hidden surveillance cameras in the dorm-room  offering four different angles of the simulated rape as it unfolds   you can watch the video here  if you choose to do so    confronting  certainly   if you’re not familiar with this story  read this  this woman is the brave face of a revolution 1 in 5 of us need   and sulkowicz knows this  she has gone to extraordinary lengths to present her video in a particular way   in a detailed trigger warning that accompanies the video  she advises that the sexual acts depicted in the video were consensually agreed upon by the actors involved in the film  however the footage has clear and intentional allusions to rape and so may be highly triggering for some viewers  sulkowicz also advises that despite the apparent parallels  the performance piece is not a re-enactment of the incident that was the focus of her protest – her own alleged dorm-room rape which occurred in 2012   that is something that has been disputed by some critics  not least because  in an earlier release of the video  the date on the footage was the same as the assault   but the penetrative sex in the film is real and this has caused considerable debate about the use of actual intercourse  as well as simulated rape  in sexual assault advocacy   interestingly  in the video’s introduction  sulkowicz asserts that she has the right to give and with-hold consent over who watches her engage in a sex-act   she argues that  just as a woman has the right to consent to one sex-act but not another  or one person but not another  she also retains a moral right to give and withold her consent concerning who is permitted to watch her engage in sexual intercourse  she says that to watch a woman without her consent is a different form of sexual assault   sulkowicz then withdraws her consent to anyone who intends to watch the video in order to hurt  objectify  dehumanise or violate her   “do not watch this video if your motives would upset me  my desires are unclear to you  or my nuances are indecipherable…  if you watch this video without my consent  then i hope you reflect on your reasons for objectifying me and participating in my rape…  “please  don’t participate in my rape  watch kindly ”  of course  because rape-culture is a thing that really does exist  thousands of men paid no more attention to her terms of consent than the male actor did the moment she began saying ‘no’ and whimpering ‘stop’   and while this proves a broader point that there is a widespread culture of ignoring a woman’s consent and disregarding her moral right to establish and maintain her own sexual boundaries  it is the way in which this point has been made has sparked widespread discomfort and debate   on the one hand  there are those who are openly critical of sulkowicz and view this as an empty attempt to garner more public attention   then there are those who feel deeply concerned for her wellbeing and are worried that this video might expose her to unwanted scrutiny and harassment  because  again  rape culture really is a thing    emma sulkowicz   others still are sympathetic towards sulkowicz  but believe that simulating a rape does not advance sexual assault advocacy at all  and only eroticises sexual violence while triggering many sexual assault survivors in the community   and finally there are those who take quite a difference stance  arguing that the reason why we are all so confronted by this video is because it challenges our pre-existing attitudes and beliefs about how victims of sexual assault are ‘supposed’ to behave   these proponents argue that by refusing to play the part of the stereotypical damaged  asexual victim  sulkowicz is taking control of her own narrative through the most taboo means available  her own sexuality   i’ll admit  i’m conflicted  but regardless of where you stand on those various points  what is revealing is that just like with everything involving sexual assault  the public focus has remained squarely on the woman’s choices and actions  there has been virtually no comment whatsoever about the choices or actions of the male director  ted lawson  or the male actor who remains anonymous  or the thousands of male viewers who have posted vicious slut-shaming and rape-apologetic comments beneath the video   emma sulkowicz previously made headlines for pledging to carry her mattress around columbia university campus until her rapist was expelled   but perhaps there should be  and perhaps instead of always focussing on women’s hemlines  or their alcohol consumption or in this instance  their wildly contentious artistic performances  what we should really focus on is the conversations that fit around those things  like these comments under the video   what the art project really succeeds in capturing is not so much a rape in progress  but rather rape-culture itself in action   everything from saying that a woman can’t change her mind midway through a sexual act  even one that turns violent  through to claims that ‘real’ rape victims would have a lot more cuts and bruises are made   as are the claims that women who say ‘no’ and ‘stop’ have no one to blame but themselves if they appear to enjoy the foreplay or if they assisted in unwrapping a condom or undressing themselves   and of course  while these comments are not remotely surprising to any one even slightly familiar with sexual assault advocacy  and sulkowicz has extensive experience in this area   it is interesting to see the complete lack of self-awareness that these men  and some women  demonstrate in forcefully penetrating a discussion space on a website set up by a woman  who has very clearly stated that she does not give consent to anyone who does not come to the conversation ‘kindly’   nor do these individuals seem to grasp the irony of the fact that they are only highlighting the need for more sexual assault advocacy   and while the court of public opinion will remain out on whether sulkowicz’s performance is an acceptable form of advocacy  what is clear is that its target  rape culture  is very much alive and intact   how does sulkowicz’s video make

happen to any woman   relentless  objectifying  obsessively fixated on the body of a new mother   i have a dream  it’s a simple dream  one where the media stops obsessing about women’s bodies  all women’s bodies  but especially when they’re pregnant or new mothers   imagine that   because this media obsession is bad for women  it’s bad for every pregnant women and every women who has a baby and every woman who wants to have a baby one day   it’s also bad for their partners who have to console them and reassure them that it’s ok that their body is bigger  or that’s ok because they’re growing another human or that it hasn’t ‘snapped back’  whatever the hell that even means  within days of leaving hospital   i like to look at photos of pregnant celebrities and famous new mums with their babies as much as the next person  pregnant women are magnificent  new mothers are incredible  new life is something to be celebrated   but did i miss the memo that said these images should be accompanied by a running commentary on that woman’s body  always  without exception  because that’s what the audience want  well  as part of the audience  can i politely say  get stuffed   i don’t want pregnant women and new mothers to be objectified mercilessly by creepy journalists writing headlines and captions praising or mocking their shape  i don’t want faux concern that they’re ‘struggling with their changing shape” or the equally faux gushing about how impressive it is that they’re “looking trim and terrific so soon after giving birth”   “i don’t want pregnant women and new mothers to be objectified mercilessly by creepy journalists writing headlines and captions praising or mocking their shape  “  who are you people   this was an almost full-page shot near the front of a major city newspaper a couple of months ago  well done  photographer  for zooming in on a new mother’s bum  congratulations art department  for blowing it up so we can all get a really really good look  superb work sub-editor who wrote the vacuous caption that reduces a woman’s worth after giving birth to the size of her arse   seriously  who are the people who do this stuff  is it women who haven’t had babies yet  is it men who have never watched their partner be consumed by the pressure and anxiety that goes with ‘getting her baby body back’   because surely it’s not women who have had children  surely no woman could be so self-loathing as to willingly feed the media machine that objectifies the bodies of mothers and pregnant women so relentlessly   like this week’s coverage of duchess kate’s “post-baby” body    the media s focus on kate middleton s post pregnant body   relentless  objectifying  obsessively fixated on the body of a new mother  what the hell is this about  who does it benefit  who wants it  because i’m honestly baffled   being pregnant makes you feel vulnerable  being a new mother makes you feel vulnerable  and these things are hard enough without this appalling public scrutiny  and you don’t have to be famous to feel it   words like “flaunting” and “unveiling” when it comes to the bodies of a new mother – or any woman –  are abhorrent  she is not a stripper  she is not a prize or a package  she is a person  who just grew and birthed another person  and she deserves some respect   did people comment on your post baby body  what was your experience    click through the gallery below for a realistic look at the first day of motherhood by jenny lewis   mothers holding their babies   for more on body image   “hey  you fat btch ” strangers actually yell this at me when i walk down the street   it’s hard to love yourself when strangers insist that you shouldn’t   yesterday should have been one of the happiest days of my life   yesterday  i graduated from university  something i’ve worked hard at for three years to achieve   but among the congratulations  there was a niggling  growing anxiety   over the past few months i’ve put on six kilos  i am now the heaviest i’ve ever been in my life  it’s not a great feeling   i struggle to feel comfortable in my clothes  my belly sticks out – making me paranoid people think i’m pregnant – and i’m avoiding social outings less and less because of four nagging words   what will people think   this aching worry has consumed every aspect of my life for years now  and the more the weight that piles on  the more it builds  if you’re my friend  or someone who’s kind  you’re probably dying to say to me  ‘who cares what people think  just be yourself ’  but what’s strange is i do like myself and who i am as a person   i just don’t like the body i have so carelessly neglected   laura at her graduation  image  supplied   and it’s pretty hard to not care what people think when i get fat-shamed by strangers   it’s only happened to me a few times  most people are considerate enough to keep their opinions to themselves   but just over a month ago  i was walking along darling harbour at dusk with a friend when i heard  “hey fatty ”  i turned my head slightly and saw a suited man looking my way  “yeah you  you fat bitch ” he said  “you are a disgrace to society  you fucking pig ”  i was shocked  i kept on walking as if i hadn’t heard a word  but the words stuck like chewing gum caught in my throat  i was scared  scared he might attack me  i was humiliated – though more for my friend than for me  was she embarrassed to be seen with me   the words haunted me for weeks   i never used to have such crippling social anxiety  now i avoid going to the beach and even going outside in daytime hours  i feel obliged to decline invitations to go out drinking or dancing and when i sit at a restaurant i make sure i’ll easily be able to manoeuvre out of my seat  i would hate to be an inconvenience to anyone   this weekend  my mum is visiting and wants to visit people she hasn’t seen in years – strangers to me  when she told me i almost cried  i don’t want to meet people  especially friends of mums’  looking the way i do  i feel like they’ll judge me and judge mum in turn  i feel like i’ve disappointed her  even though i know she loves me and my brother more than anything   anxiety is fucking with my brain  i have never felt like this  i have never felt ashamed to be me  but now i do   the body image issues start from a young age  image  tumblr   my worst fears about graduation were confirmed when  instead of feeling elated that all those years of study were over  all i could think about was looking like a marshmallow in the photos  these fears were justifiable  i received the official portraits and immediately began to cry  i looked monstrous  this is how i will look back on that day  these photos are what my future children will look at  i am disgusted that i have let myself get into this state   it hasn’t always been this bad  i have been overweight ever since i can remember  due to no fault of my parents  it’s my self-control that lets me down  i avoid exercise like the plague and i can never say no to a piece of chocolate  or eight   i’m an emotional eater  it’s a deadly cycle  if i’m happy  a celebratory dinner  sad  a bag of maltesers  food makes me happy  food makes all of my problems go away  until it doesn’t  until food is the problem  food  a need for human existence  will kill me one day if i don’t change my habits   and it’s not as if all i eat is junk  i like vegies  i eat them every day  i actively attempt to make each meal i have be a healthy one  it’s the brownie i sometimes buy as a treat on a friday  or the peanut butter toast i sometimes substitute for muesli  when i get to work in the morning  or the satay chicken i get delivered when i can’t be bothered cooking   these impulsive choices i make bring happiness for five minutes  then instantaneous regret  it feels like i have no control  which i know probably sounds ludicrous  but there’s just something in my brain that switches  i always succumb to the devil on my shoulder   “i always succumb to the devil on my shoulder”  image  supplied   my other issue  i have a commitment problem  i have tried dieting  but i go three days and fall off the wagon  i have tried weight watchers  which i know would work if i could stick to it  the best i have gone is a month – i lost eight kilos then for one reason or another lost focus   as i always do   but i have joined again  and this time i have a goal in mind  i leave for a mini europe holiday in 3 months and want to have lost the weight i have put on in the last few  just enough to feel a bit more comfortable   and then the real challenge will begin when i get back  changing habits for the long-term  it will be an uphill battle  but i’m ready   have you ever been publicly criticised for your weight how orange is the new black compares to life in a us women’s prison   it’s hilarious  but is it authentic   i joke that i should have written orange is the new black   like piper  i was a middle-class girl very much out of her depth in an american prison  like piper  drug smuggling put me there  unlike piper  when i was in there i discovered i was pregnant with my daughter  mabel   for more of carlotta’s story  read  i’m a convicted drug mule  and i stand for mercy   so it was with some trepidation i sat down to watch the first series  especially as my then 16-year-old daughter and her friends had seen it   it prompted a barrage of questions from her  “was it really like that ” the answer was more often than not  “yes  it was ”  it’s the humour in the experience that is surprisingly real  when the chips are down  the black humour people turn to carry them forward is humanity at its best   former prisoner carlotta goulden-allum  image  supplied   the first thing i did when i entered the prison wing for the first time was approach a table of friendly-looking faces and break down and cry  begging them to look after me  which they did  they shared their things with me  cooked for me  made me tea and reassured me that i would get used to it  that it wasn’t so bad  it did happen to be a table of white women  prison in america is very ghettoised with the white  black and hispanic girls keeping themselves to themselves  not necessarily in a cruel or confrontational way   it’s just the way it is   i was terrified  but people are surprisingly resilient  i found i soon established my friends and my routine  most women in prison are lonely and scared  there are only a few real hard nuts  and they keep themselves to themselves  women care about each other  and the humanity and the helping  the friendship and the camaraderie  is something that really affected stays and me with me still   watch piper on her first day in prison on oitnb   owning things in prison is a big deal  i spent the first two weeks with nothing  just my prison issue clothes and a couple of items given to me from my new friends  mary  a chinese woman  gave me some hair conditioner and a bowl  susan bought me toothpaste and toothbrush and a plastic drinking cup  everyone carried around their plastic mugs all the time for tea and water   until my money came through i could not buy anything form the ‘canteen’ – so the few items that i slowly collected became precious  one quickly starts doing what every one else does  collecting cereal boxes at breakfast to eat later in the day  stashing fruit and precious items  sleeping for hours in the middle of the day   when i was in la there were some overtly lesbian couples  where the ‘man’ was very aggressive and butch and her girlfriend very coquettish and girly – i kept well away from the mind games  carmen  a young party-girl  who was a friend of mine  flirted with tony  the ‘man’   who was actually quite charming and cathy  his b tch  attacked her  i thought carmen had been silly  she was obviously used to flirting and getting attention from guys on the outside   alex and piper are a reunited couple on orange is the new black   prison is a little microcosm of society so anything that was going to happen on the outside happens quicker and harder in prison  you soon fall into a ‘role’ or a type so you can be ‘read’ easily by other inmates  of course women get close  in lots of different ways  i think as women we find it easy to slip into quite a tactile  loving relationship  in the middle of the night when you are using the toilet and doing everything in front of your cellmate  if it’s a friend you feel a bit like a married couple   i’ve known some women act like male studs in prison  looking and acting like handsome young men do  i could see the attraction and the charisma  we all want a pair of strong arms around us for a cuddle  everything is magnified in prison  so a relationship that often feels intense and all consuming inside is probably forgotten all too quickly once they are tossed back into their ‘real’ lives   many women’s prisons have a matriarchal character like red   people seemed to like me and on the whole i was looked after  just like in oitnb there was a matriarchal figure similar to ‘red’ – she was called mama gloria  a hispanic woman who ran the laundry  her whole family was in a mexican cartel and she had taken the rap for one of her children  her husband was in the men’s side of the prison and struggling mentally  she was always making us laugh saying he needed to ‘grow some balls’  she ran the laundry and had a lot of hispanic girls working for her  mama gloria took a shine to me and washed and ironed all my clothes  she arranged for some clothes to be altered for me as my pregnant tummy began to show   everyone thought my english accent was ‘neat’ and i got a lot of questions about princess diana  as though i knew her  the white girls thought i was funny  the black girls thought i was clever and the hispanics thought i was pretty  so i had all bases covered  i kept my head down  we were up every morning at 5am for breakfast at 6am  beds had to made and cells tidy in the morning  we took it in turn to clean the showers  a few cells at a time with one of the ‘old timers’ in charge   one of the scariest moments for me was when i took a shower a bit late and they were coming round for inspection  a particularly scary inmate called lucinda who was probably schizophrenic came banging on the door saying  ‘which b    is still in the shower ruining our f   ing inspection ’ – i scurried out in tears apologizing – ‘f   ing english ’  that was what some of the women called me   the realities of a women’s prison  image  supplied   prisons infantilise you  i see it happen to women today and i definitely felt it happen to me  you become child-like  as you don’t take responsibility for yourself and constantly told what to do  like in the school playground  the girls form cliques and stupid arguments start over seemingly insignificant issues  we had a lot of arguments over the scrabble dictionary for example  women in prison are on edge  and often things can be going on behind the scenes or in their court cases that distract them so moodiness and ‘losing it’ are commonplace  just like at school  some girls are fighters  some girls cause trouble  i wasn’t one of them  but there were regular fights  some girls were known for it  ‘crazy cathy has kicked off again  she’s in the hole’ was a common utterance  i would not dare even look at her   crazy eyes has a reputation for being a fighter on oitnb   trips to the doctors and health care were quite an interesting pastime in prison  a break from the norm – anything that got us out of the daily routine was desirable  a day in healthcare was much more interesting than hanging around the wing  the doctor was a new face  as my routine medical showed me to be pregnant i got a lot of healthcare attention  much to the annoyance of some of my ‘friends’   one woman  patty  who became a bit of stalker  actually tried to fake a pregnancy for the attention  there is a lot of mental illness in prison as the women are vulnerable  i see it in the women i work with now  they obsess about their doctor visits  what drugs they are on  what food they eat  what they heard is available in other prisons  how bad things are at this one  it is often just a long-winded cry for help and attention  self-harming when alone in your cell is rife   the original book of oitnb is actually a much shrewder critique of the justice system than the series  of course in the series we do not see the quiet moments weeping over letters  or the private drawing of blood  or the shame and embarrassment when confronted by your family – that is a different kind of programme  when i look through my letters i wrote from prison i track my mood changes within each letter from terror  humour  sadness  frustration and desperation to quiet acceptance   prison was an experience that shaped the rest of my life  as i now run a charity that works with prisoners  mostly women  i am committed and driven to help their welfare and give them a voice   only the other day my daughter mabel was telling me that a friend of hers had read something i had written and said  “omg  your mum has been to prison  that’s so cool  ”  it really is not   flick through the gallery below for more on carlotta’s work in women’s prisons    carlotta s work   have you ever experienced the inside of a woman’s prison  do you know someone who has open post come and tell us about your week   the pain of breaking your wrist as an adult   welcome back to open post  for anyone who’s new here  this is where we get to talk about what’s going on in our lives this week – the funny  sad  awkward – nothing is off limits   i’ll start  i’m not going to deny it  i’m a klutz  i always have a stain on my shirt and i have a weird collection of bruises i don’t remember getting  this week  i managed to outdo myself and break my wrist   so  what does that mean for a klutzy  left-handed woman  six weeks of total impending awkwardness   here are just a few of the awkward activities i’ve experienced so far   1  eating   i’m pretty sure it’s scientifically impossible to put on weight when half the food doesn’t even make it into your mouth  so that’s a plus   there’s also that mortifying moment when your dad has to cut your food in public   2  showering   this requires some serious innovation  think hospital vomit bag  elastic bands and enough cling wrap to make even dexter concerned   3  dressing   while i have mastered the art of the one-handed pant pull  the bra is a whole other issue  let’s just say my mum and i have gotten particularly friendly of late   how’s everyone else’s week going  does anyone else feel my cast life pain ‘i always knew there was something different about my middle son ’  i didn’t want to face what it was   it’s so easy to talk yourself out of something you don’t want to be true   i have talked myself out of the belief that my son is autistic for three years  and maybe longer  i’ve always known there was something different about him  giovanni  7  is my middle child  and it was becoming harder to write off his behaviour as ‘middle child syndrome’   “i didn’t spend enough time with him when he was little ” i’d tell his teachers  to explain why he was a little isolated from others and hard to teach    read more  cage used for autistic child was not an isolated case   “i fell pregnant when he was seven-months-old and put him in front of the tv too often ” i told friends  to explain his american accent and strange inflection when he spoke   i used to talk about it with friends and work colleagues and constantly ask his carers and teachers if they thought he ‘was on the spectrum’  i filled in endless online quizzes all suggesting he probably was autistic  i would watch him carefully  how he would only eat certain foods in a particular way  at our favourite restaurant  we’d all dig into elaborate meals and he’d ask for 10 chicken nuggets which he would painstakingly cut into quarters before taking his first bite   jo with her son giovanni on a ride  image  supplied   he’s just quirky…  he’s just unusual…  he’s just special…   giovanni doesn’t seem to comprehend things like other kids his age  he is unable to make and maintain friendships  he can’t stand sudden loud noises   he sits alone on a silver seat at school each day  eating and playing with his shoe laces  overwhelmed by the idea of making and maintaining friendships  he can never tell me how he feels  except to tell me  “i love you so much mum ”  he can never say he is happy  sad  frustrated or confused  just  “i love you so much mum  and you love me so much too ”  it took a visit to his classroom during a parent-volunteer session to shake me awake from my delusion that he was ‘normal’  struggling to get him to focus  to stop mindlessly destroying the work and belongings of others  to prevent him from becoming overwhelmed by his surroundings and lose concentration  his teachers had set up a special desk for him  pushed right up against their desk at the front of the class  with one  lone seat  just for him  when he showed me his new place in class my heart just broke  it was time to find out once and for all what is going on with my son   read more  “would i have had my son if i had known he would be autistic ”  i made some enquiries and found a child behavioural psychologist who was able to diagnose him with autism spectrum disorder  just as i had suspected all along but was too afraid to confirm   now  with his formal diagnosis in hand i can stop burying my head in the sand  i’ll admit it  i was avoiding a diagnosis and hoping it would sort itself out  hoping it would just go away  it was too much  my oldest has life-threatening food allergies  i can’t have an autistic son too   jo’s three children playing  image  supplied   except that i do  i have a son who has autism spectrum disorder and who will need a helping hand in some of the basics like understanding written instructions  making friends  keeping friends  understanding that not all loud noises signal danger   should i have organised his assessment years ago  yes  i should have  i just didn’t want it to be true  i dreaded it  like it would make him worse or something  silly  i know   he is who he is and it is my job to make sure he gets everything he needs to have the best life possible  now that i have his diagnosis  i know how to do that and can stop guessing   to learn more about how autism is diagnosed  watch the video below   if you suspect your child

time to ‘fess up   i am a man   well  okay  sort of broadly a man  i don’t really like cars  or know how to fix things  and it is possible that i sometimes re-read my sister’s sweet valley highs  but i’m certainly enough of a man to know that the ability to pee standing up and look ugly naked  does not necessarily lead to a lifetime of privilege   men are a lot more likely to commit suicide than women  or end up on drugs or homeless  we make up the minority of university students  and the vast majority of prisoners  and – whether it be picking up rubbish bins or going down a mine – we’re often saddled with society’s worst jobs   so  looking at the world through that lens  it’s hard to see why the “men’s rights movement”  or “mrm”  to use the lingo  should not be a positive thing  after all  we have cyclists’ rights and tenants’ rights and workers’ rights and animals’ rights  why should 50  of the population not have few groups beat the rights drum as well   “why don’t you have a chat with some of them ” said my editor at mamamia  and i said “okay ” with a weary sigh  but it turns out that making contact with australia’s 200 or so men’s rights  as opposed to father’s rights  activists is more easily said than done   earlier this year  hundreds of anti-feminist men chose to wear the controversial  meninist shirt  image via pinterest   if these people are having meetings  they more or less have them in secret  and if they have an email address  then they don’t seem to use it   “you cop a lot of flak for being a man who speaks out about men and men’s issues ” says one of the few activists that i did manage to get a hold of  a townsville gp called dr greg canning  “i’m fairly lucky in that i’m self-employed and i don’t care what people write about me or say about me  i get awful things said about me all the time and so be it  but a lot of people can’t afford to put their livelihood or career in jeopardy by saying something that’s politically incorrect ”  the man has a point  if the mrm was to enter a popularity contest  it would end up somewhere between leprosy and cardinal george pell  the general perception is that it’s an intellectually-bereft ragbag of angry white men  men who have recently been defeated in a rather poisonous custody battle  or got their arse kicked in a costly divorce  men whose politics are rather to the right of the spectrum  and whose finances are not what they were  men who are angry and hurting  and keen to take a swing at the opposite sex   and as it happens  this all pretty true   to wade into the world of mrm websites is to wade into a world of “tart-brain bitches” and “vicious sluts”  a world in which feminists are “fat lesbian man haters” and “a disease that must be extirpated ”  improving the plight of men  for many mrm activists  does not seem to have much to do with actual activism  practical  sensible policy initiatives  like  say  shortening working hours or tweaking a few teaching methods  or maybe setting up some more men’s shelters or suicide hotlines  are not exactly the order of the day   this is the kind of meme you can enjoy on an mrm website   instead  “male liberation” involves fighting  and defeating  an enemy – and that enemy  needless to say  is feminism  women may earn less than men  spend the rest of their time doing chores  and get killed or raped in numbers every week  but it turns out that they’re all in charge  every improvement in the plight of women has apparently come at the expense of us men   until now  at least  “simply put  we are coming for you ” says paul elam  the “brains” behind us website  a voice for men  avfm   a particularly vocal opponent of the “feminist jackboot”  “all of you  and by the time we are done you will wax nostalgic over the days when all you had to deal with was someone expressing a desire to f ck you up your shop-worn ass … avfm regards feminists and manginas  feminist men  … as a social malignancy … we extend to them no more courtesy or consideration than we would klansmen  skinheads  neo nazis or other purveyors of hate ”  golly …  paul elam  founder of a voice for men  such a lovely chap   greg canning  as it happens  is avfm’s “australian news director”  his colourful history of fighting “titty hall” includes an offer to contribute funds to paul elam’s efforts to track down an anonymous feminist blogger who clearly gave him the shits   “get ready to live a life of misery  you worthless irish slut  we will never let you escape ”   but canning now says that he regrets having been “a bit extreme” in the past  “i don’t advocate being misogynistic and violent and burning down courthouses or whatever ”  so what  then  stripped of all vitriol  are these men’s rights “issues” he speaks of  in what ways has my life been destroyed by all you “feminazis  bimbo-sapiens and parasites”   ok  sorry  will stop quoting now    and another lovely meme to brighten your day   issue one  canning says  is child custody – and that might just an issue where mrm has a bit of a point  it does appear  to the observer  that australia’s child custody arrangements tend to favour the mother   but there are many father’s rights groups at work in this wide  brown land  and they’re  generally  a different beast to the mrm  they don’t see a sinister feminist cabal lurking in australia’s corridors of power – they just think that something’s a bit askew in the family court  “there is still a long way to go to achieve equality ” says the president of the lone fathers association  barry williams  “but this is not going to be achieved by denouncing the mother of the children”   issue two  for men’s rights activists  is violence against women  according to canning  it’s not as common as  well  every statistician thinks  a man who grew up with six sisters  and “a copy of the female eunuch on the bookshelf in our home ” he got involved with the mrm after going through a particularly ugly divorce  “i had a domestic violence order taken out against me which was trivial and false  but under advice from my legal people i accepted it without admission  of guilt  for the sake of not inflaming what was already a high conflict situation ” says the fifty-something year old  who has since married veronika  a clinical psychologist   “but i am now aware that that is a very common tactic used in divorce situations for people to gain an upper hand  and the sad thing is that men are becoming aware of this too … so you start to see stories coming through of women who say that they’ve been falsely accused so that the man can get the upper hand in things ”  “very common”  really  it could well be true that false accusations are levelled every now and then  but you could say the same thing about any crime  far more common  i’d guess  would be battered wives who say nothing  for fear of being hit yet again   anyway  where were we  “i think that domestic violence orders need to be assessed properly ” says canning  “the same way that the legal system would assess any crime ”  like most of canning’s arguments  this one carries a faint whiff of truth – but at the same time  clearly stinks  the standard way in which the legal system assesses crimes tends to take years and a lot of hard-to-find evidence  handing out prevention orders to women who ask for them may well have screwed over 100 or more men  but it’s almost certainly saved thousands of lives   issue three  believe it or not  is violence against men  “it’s assumed that women can’t or won’t be violent  whereas in reality they can be ” says canning  “they don’t do it as often as men  that’s true  but if you’re a victim it doesn’t matter if it’s a male or a female that attacked you  you’re still a victim  so i just see a lot of double standards in the debate about this ”  eamon evans  image  eamonevans com  hmm   it’s hard to disgree with canning’s argument that a victim is a victim  but it would also be a hard to find a feminist who does  he may as well argue that a table’s a table  or assert that a chair is a chair  of course it is not ok for a 50kg women to hit a 80kg man  but if he hits her back  i’d say that that’s as bad or worse …  dr canning  however  would not say this  “the perception is that if it’s a male and a female  having a biff  then the male is always at fault … a lot of family violence is mutual and combative  where both partners use violence ” he hates the way “officially sanctioned feminist propaganda … paints all women as blameless victims of male violence and patriarchal oppression … and victim blaming can never be allowed ”  hmmm  now  there’s no doubt that i’d be a bit silly if i took a stroll through some dodgy part of the city fingering money at 4am  but would i be to blame if i got beaten up  no  whoever attacked me would be  canning’s position seems dangerously close to “some women ask to be raped” territory – though  in fairness  he doesn’t quite go there   his ever-charming editor at avfm does  of course  paul elam is not a fan of women who “walk through life with the equivalent of a i’m a stupid  conniving bitch—please rape me neon sign glowing above their empty little narcissistic heads ”   but as far as canning – a climate change denier and martial arts enthusiast – is concerned  he’s just showing “compassion” for all parties  and compassion is something that feminists tend to have in short supply  “men  who talk about a problem  are often shouted down ” he says  “whereas when women have problems  they tend to get listened to … i think that men kill themselves far more often than they kill partners or children ”  he recently resigned from a part-time teaching position at townsville’s james cook university because of a feminist colleague’s “sexual vilification” of men  she  he says  is “at the extreme side of feminism  which started out as a movement of equality to bring equal rights to men and women ”  “but even though that’s largely been achieved  there’s still a group of people who believe men are evil … i think that there’s a whole lot of double standards out there  and that there are two sides to the sexism and discrimination argument  at the end of the day  i just see myself as someone arguing for some degree of fairness in the whole thing ”  me  well  at the end of the day  i think that greg needs to take a few chill pills  and maybe get a hobby  like building a men’s shelter   do you have any sympathy for the men’s rights movement a divine sign the catholic church should change its views on same sex marriage   a sign from above  surely   this wonderful photo was taken yesterday afternoon  a big  bright gay-pride rainbow  right above st mary’s cathedral in sydney   could anything give a clearer indication that the catholic church needs to change its views on same-sex-marriage than a bona fide ‘finger-of-god ’ appearing over the certified ‘house-of-god ’  the gorgeous image was especially poignant  after a ‘pastoral letter’ from the catholic bishops of australia was sent home with school kids attending catholic institutions this week   the letter declares  members of the catholic church “deplore injustices perpetrated upon people because of religion  race  sex  age etc ” and yet  church officials continue to fail to recognise the legitimacy same-sex marriage   to support same-sex marriage is to undermine the ‘very soul’ of matrimony  the leaflet states  according to the catholic bishops of australia  marriage should only be between a man and a woman   “their physical  spiritual  psychological and sexual differences show they are meant for each other  their union makes them whole  and through their union ‘in one flesh’ they together beget children who are ‘flesh of their flesh’  they share the sameness of humanity but enjoy the difference of their masculinity and femininity  being husband and wife  paternity and maternity ”  well  it appears even god is calling bs on that one it’s here  your first look at season 3 of the bachelor   it’s coming   the very first trailer for season three of the bachelor has been released  and everything is as it should be   there’s the bachelor  sam wood  his white teeth gleaming mesmerisingly  speaking earnestly about his desire to find the love of his life   and then there’s his harem the girls  each more beautiful than the last and possessed of a wardrobe that consists solely of evening wear and bikinis   “if you told me five years ago i was going to be australia’s next bachelor  i would have laughed at you ” wood says   listen  osher gunsberg totally dishes on sam wood and the bachelor   “this is by far the craziest thing i’ve ever done for love  in fact  it’s probably the craziest thing i’ve ever done ”  in the 90-second teaser  the 34-year-old personal trainer from tassie professes to be just a “laid-back  regular aussie guy” looking for love   and though i am inwardly scoffing  let’s recall that season one’s tim robards and anna heinrich are still together   and while last year’s winner sam frost was unceremoniously dumped after the show  bach blake garvey took up with her runner-up louise pillidge and the two are apparently also still seeing each other   wood says in the video that he knew the ladies would be smokin’ hot  writer’s words  he said “beautiful” or something boring  but he didn’t know quite how much fun they’d be   read  loudmouth firecrackers   this should be fun   no word yet on the air-date  but we’ll keep you posted please stop inviting me to your tupperwarearbonnethermomixintimo parties  i don’t want your crap   if you haven’t been invited to one of these social abominations yet  you deserve a high-five and a chocolate milkshake because you just dodged a bullet   someone told to me recently that home shopping parties are making a comeback   you know the ones  tupperware  lingerie  fancy expensive blenders  skin cream  jewellery  makeup  candles  cleaning things   sold on the premise that they allows both busy women to shop in the convenience of their own home and buy exclusive products that aren’t available in your run-of-the-mill bricks and mortar stores  home selling parties are the super bug of friendship circles   nothing infiltrates or kills faster than “hey guys  come over for dinner  i have the most amazing business opportunity ”  it generally involves a group of women  well-meaning family and friends of the host  nervous people with no money but a willingness to support the venture  standing around eating carrot sticks and hummus in an unnaturally tidy dining room   everyone stands around admiring the domestic bliss and sipping politely from their cups of juice  and then we partake in the ritual that is home shopping  faking enthusiasm for the products  ooh-ing and aah-ing over the cosmetics plastic containers  jewellery underwear  and not at any single point mentioning that you are missing tonight’s episode of masterchef for this   and here’s what happens every  time   i start out cynical   but by my fifth carrot stick i am convinced this contraption device cream will save my life from the shambolic mess it is   and there’s never any mention of price  only how incredibly life-changing these things are  and i find myself going from crunching on a piece of carrot  to guzzling snake oil like a person possessed with the thirst of shane warne   and then inevitably  it comes to the ‘hard sell’ moment  and that’s when things get awkward  because everything is really expensive   and in your weekly budget  once you get past rent food bills  you generally don’t factor in a  300 magic tummy pants lingerie set   if you buy the token cheapest thing you feel like a stinge-arse  and besides  the seller isn’t that keen on selling you the cheapest thing   they want you to buy the special pack because that is “saving you money”  and there’s silence  a lot of silence   and in your head is a mix of “f  k  this thing really will change my life   i need this ” and “f  k  i cannot afford this  what am i doing   ” and then the largest one of all “f  k  how do i get out of this with my friendship intact ”  because you’ve just sat through a 45 minute presentation with a charming sales person  and you’ve eaten spring rolls by now  and the mixture of guilt  peer pressure  loyalty to your friend and want for more spring rolls is telling you to buy something   and that is why i hate home shopping parties   i hate the guilt  i hate the awkwardness  i hate trying on bras in someone’s living room  i hate feeling like i want to please my friends by buying needless crap i can’t afford  and i hate that i have to spend my hard earned so they can get 50  off their purchases   i hate that they prey on the very women they are supposed to empower  why don’t you see men hosting home shopping parties  because these companies rely on women’s guilt shame empathy and need to please   one time is fine  i’m happy to support you  be a good friend  and besides  i really like eating dip  even though i don’t have the cash to drop on whatever you’re selling  i will come and i will probably buy the cheapest thing in the catalogue   but know this   it is yuck   yuck   yuck   yuck   i know there are some great products out there and it’s a great way for some mums to earn extra income   but if you were starting any small business  would you rely on the constant goodwill of your friends and family to prop it up  would you badger people into hosting events for you  would there be the underlying feeling you’re at the bottom end of the pyramid scheme   getting together with friends is one of my greatest joys  i just don’t want the hard sell  and these days  the convenience of shopping at home can be found on the internet  not at my friend’s houses   thanks for understanding   when was the last time you went to one of these parties  did you buy anything  zoo weekly removes images of bikini-clad model holding poppy  dva says  lad mag zoo weekly has removed all  offending  images of a bikini-clad model brandishing a long poppy stem to mark the centenary of gallipoli  according to the department of veterans  affairs   the front page of zoo s special anzac commemorative edition features the typically near-naked model dwarfing a tiny figure of a wwi digger standing at ease at her hip   zoo promoted the issue on its facebook page  calling it the anzac commemorative issue  but the word  anzac  is protected by federal legislation and cannot be used for commercial purposes without the express permission of the dva   the dva was advised that zoo had removed  all offending content   a spokesperson said  and the image of the bikini model and the poppy no longer features on the magazine s facebook page      any commercial use of the word  anzac  requires permission from the minister for veterans  affairs   the dva warned   the issue  released in the lead up to the anzac day weekend  included a 10-page feature detailing  100 things every aussie should know about gallipoli  and an interview with cover model erin pash   asked whether she likes a man in

orders…  a   laughs   yeah  they do what they re told  plus they can usually get down and do 100 push ups in a row  which is impressive    facebook users were quick to criticise the front page on zoo s fan page  with one commenter posting   sweet merciful jesus what idiotic editorial director possibly thought this was a good idea    a second commenter simply wrote  this is disgusting  and a third urged people not to buy the issue   zoo has been contacted for comment   the magazine s racy nod to the centenary followed woolworths  disastrous marketing campaign that traded on the anzac remembrance by splashing the supermarket giant s logo and the words  anzac     fresh in our memories  across the image of a wwi digger     target was also forced to pull three anzac-branded products

the caribbean and cancun   shannah writes   there are so many emotions now that i have stopped working  i am an achievement junkie  so it is exciting to have the opportunity to think about achievement in new ways  i am excited to experience new things and  being a beach person  to see what it is like to be a mountain person  i am excited to have time  time to explore  feel  learn  grow  be in the moment and master more of myself  work on being the best version of me i can be in life  and i m excited to get out of melbourne in winter  i really struggle with the cold   i m also feeling fear about leaving my beloved routines and structures  and anxiety that i may not actually like being in a pause  that sounds quite bizarre  but i love my job  my home  my existence here in melbourne  the  what ifs   are there in my mind  what if i don t like it  what if i don t get the space i need as a person who likes calm in her life  what if i don t like being with the kids round the clock  i have to challenge myself to have no expectations of the family or the places  and to enjoy everything for what it is   i am  filled with determination to learn  to learn more about photography  about life  about computers and it  as i am falling behind  michael is our it department and i have let him be that  but i need to learn how it all works so i can help myself  i want to think about the next stage of our lives and what i need to do to capture and enjoy every moment   i am feeling gratitude  bucketloads of it  firstly  that we are fortunate enough to be able to do this trip  i am grateful that michael and i are both adventurous and courageous enough to make the bold decisions and make things happen for ourselves  neither of us wait for opportunities  we both go out and make them  i am grateful i have the courage to leave my business for a while and let it breathe  to be authentic and live the life i have chosen  i have incredible gratitude for my marriage  and that we operate as a team  that we have had the best 10 years and that each year seems to get better  faster and more exciting than the last   but mostly  i am deeply happy  - with my life  with my marriage  with my beautiful children  we are all healthy  physically and mentally  and this is why i want to take a pause – to deeply experience this   michael writes   well  here i am  sitting in dubai  after a work trip  about to jump on a plane and spend 14 hours  flying home before packing up and heading off  on another 30-hour journey in six days  time  normally  this would be something to dread  however  this time i can t wait to jump into row 59 with my family and begin a trip we ll remember for the rest of our lives    i ve always had a strong motivation to take time out and spend   months overseas as a family unit  firstly  because of my vivid  fond childhood memories of an extended road trip with my family  and secondly  because i believe we owe it to ourselves to stop  think and work out how the hell we got to where we are today and how we can continue to make our lives awesome in the future   i am proud we take risks  i am proud we act  rather than talk  and i am most proud that we have done it all by ourselves with no help from anyone  there is little doubt life will throw curve balls at us from time to time  but this trip will be a bonding experience that will be ours and ours alone   i think the reason i have managed to be successful in my job and my life over the past  10 years is mostly due to shannah – how amazing she is at home  in business and in life  she sets standards that don t allow me to drop my guard or accept the easy path  it has become second nature for me to take chances and follow my instincts    i love my kids  i love spending quality time with them  i hope to find a new level of connection and calm in our relationship  i look forward to bonding with them both  we are a close family  but there is more work to do there    i can t wait to go home to the mountains  in some funny way i know they have been a big part of my life  i love the casualness and informality – mountain people don t take themselves too seriously  but they really appreciate and love the environment around them   i m looking forward to learning new skills  it has been a long time since i actually started something from scratch  as a beginner  whether it is biking  fishing or rv-ing  i am looking forward to learning again   so let s embrace the pause  open our minds  get on that plane and get the hell out of hampton for a while  bring it on   recollections  reading these pre-departure journals again after our trip really heightened what we got out of it  we had a greater appreciation for the bold steps we had taken to make sure that what we wanted most in life actually happened  and i realised that my fears about being away for so long were unfounded   writing journals before and after holidays or before a big deal is made  or even just writing down thoughts and emotions  can be really helpful in aiding our growth and evolution  the more we understand ourselves and take ownership of our lives  the richer they will be   this is an edited extract from the life plan  simple strategies for a meaningful life  by shannah kennedy  lantern   39 99   shannah kennedy is a life coach in constant demand by entrepreneurs  executives  managers  celebrities and professional athletes   shannahkennedy com gwyneth was right  conscious uncoupling works  chris martin and gwyneth paltrow have been seen enjoying time together with their children since the  conscious uncoupling     conscious uncoupling   the phrase  washed up on the shore of the english language last year with all the style and subtlety of a rotting whale    deposited by celebrity tsunami gwyneth paltrow  who used it to describe her split from coldplay lead singer chris martin  it furnished comic nourishment for many  while others wrinkled their nose at the pungent whiff of new age euphemism   i ve heard in the us there are now people having relationship funerals       pierz newton-john  now that the initial odour has dissipated  though  is there something of value in the bare bones  the answer  almost certainly  is yes  for beneath the thick crust of   hollywoodness  what paltrow was trying to describe was an amicable divorce  in which the welfare of the children was paramount  and who could argue with that   for those wanting to know more  conscious uncoupling  the self-help manual  will appear in bookstores this september  written by relationship expert katherine woodward thomas  who coined the term and also offers online seminars in conscious uncoupling   400 a pop   it is a slightly difficult read  peppered as it is with references to  source fracture wounds  and sentences such as  in a nutshell  a break-up is nothing short of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have a complete spiritual awakening     but beyond the exuberant self-empowerment -  your mission right now is to reclaim your power and your life  - conscious uncoupling is about trying to minimise the pain and hostility involved in ending a relationship  particularly when there are children involved  and not making the same mistakes over and over again  so its heart is in the right place  but does it pass the reality test    the good news is that experts agree that the good break-up is possible  and they ve been helping people achieve it for many years  clinical psychologist amanda gordon said it s about being considerate and mindful of your soon-to-be-ex  and acknowledging that there will be pain for all parties  particularly if one is still committed to the relationship    what gordon is wary of is viewing separation as a first resort  particularly given the known benefit of having children grow up with both parents  the initial step  she says  is trying to save the relationship  a difficult but not impossible task  particularly with professional help   couples who see a counsellor find that it works in up to 70 per cent of cases  according to recent research     people find it easier to leave each other because everyone is doing it   gordon said   there s a bit of a myth that relationships become irretrievable  but when you get people into counselling  frequently parents decide they can make it work for children    if what is being said is that we should make healthy decisions about separating there s fairness in that  on the other hand  if people are consciously coupling  there won t be any separation    and while there is consensus that seeing a counsellor will give a couple the best chance of parting company on speaking terms  there s also a shared belief that anything promoting civilised separation can t be bad     no one could take issue with that  especially where there s children involved   says psychologist and social commentator lyn bender   there s so much loss and disruption involved in the end of a relationship  and rage that comes from one partner feeling let down and cheated     anything that helps take the rancour out of separation  anything that helps the kids not feel torn into shreds by the whole thing  that s got to be good    so if the good news is that a conscious uncoupling is more than a bust-up with a side of activated almonds  the bad news is more and more of us are going to have a chance to find out for ourselves  abs figures show a third of australian marriages will end in divorce  with nearly half of those involving children  in 2013 alone  there were more than 47 000 divorces  so there s a lot of incentive  both on a societal and individual level  to do it well   in conscious uncoupling  woodward thomas argues part of the solution is to change the way we think and talk about the end of a relationship  to find words other than  failure  and  breakdown   if we take away the stigma of breaking up  she believes  you take away some of the pain    pierz newton-john  a philosopher  psychotherapist and teacher of  a relationship course at melbourne s school of life  agrees     i ve heard in the us there are now people having relationship funerals  where the separating parties have a kind of ceremony  to acknowledge what they gained and what was good   he said     it s part of this whole movement of recasting the notion of a relationship ending as a failure  to move on is not necessarily anybody s failure  values change  one person might not move in the same direction as the other – there s all sorts of reasons why a relationship might reach a natural end   he says    i think the blame game comes from an outdated model  i m in favour of anything that helps us move on  to accept change and to be able to accept loss as part of life  if we can grieve for the end of a relationship but not treat it as a statement on one s loveability  that s a positive    so back to the reality test  how has it worked out for paltrow and martin  fairly well  apparently  after expressing some regrets last december  and thereby proving her humanity  paltrow and martin have been recently photographed taking their children out together  and having a whale of a time  apparently meditation isn t always relaxing  new study finds  relaxing for your mind  activating for your heart  meditation   meditation is many things  but it is not always relaxing   it restores clarity  relieves stress  changes our brains for the better  encourages creativity and calms our nervous system  headspace com science  but a new study has found that we experience elevated heart rates during certain types of meditation   participants in the study were asked to practise loving-kindness meditation  thought-observation meditation and a relaxing breathing meditation technique   the neuroscience researchers found that heart rate and effort were higher during loving-kindness meditation and observing-thoughts meditations    in contrast to implicit beliefs that meditation is always relaxing and associated with low arousal  the current results show that core meditations aiming at improving compassion and meta-cognitive skills require effort and are associated with physiological arousal compared to breathing meditation   the authors said   the results support the idea of a  meditation paradox   where  like the  sleep paradox   restoration appears to activate and intensify biological processes   in the case of meditation  certain techniques activate rather than calm cardiac rhythms   the findings suggest using different practices for specific outcomes   despite the heart rate change  meditation appears to be good for the heart  depending on the type you do  that is   in one recent study  201 people with coronary heart disease were asked to either participate in a health education classes or transcendental meditation  tm  classes  when researchers followed up with the participants five years later  they found the meditators had reduced their risk of heart attack  stroke or premature death by 48 per cent   while meditation might not be relaxing as far as our heart is concerned  even if it is healthy for our hearts  many also find meditation hard in others ways    even after many years  many of us continue to practise harshly   writes meditation teacher pema chodron  in when things fall apart    we practise with guilt  as if we re going to be excommunicated if we don t do it right  we practise so we won t be ashamed of ourselves and with fear that someone will discover what a  bad  meditator we really are    contrary to popular belief  meditation is not about an iron-fisted ability to stop thought or fidget    most people assume that meditation is all about stopping thoughts  getting rid of emotions  somehow controlling the mind  but actually it s much different than that   says andy puddicombe   the founder of headspace    it s more about stepping back  seeing the thought clearly- witnessing it coming and going - without judgment  but with a relaxed  focus mind    a relaxed  focused mind  but an activated heart do women really want men to last longer in bed  longer lasting sex  is it really what women want  photo  yuri arcurs  how often do we still see the shocking large bill boards at the side of the road and those annoying advertisements on tv after 11pm with slogans like   call now and you too can last longer    the companies behind these ads make millions of dollars promising men longer and better sexual performance  and some men like the anonymity of such a service because they are often too embarrassed to see their gp or visit a sex therapist   mostly the company  doctors  don t see the men in their practice  they just talk to them over the phone and prescribe expensive treatments  such as nasal sprays or oral strips  without a proper medical consultation  the cost of these treatments  often a contract  can be as high as  2000  the fact that many gps are also not comfortable talking about sex with their patients  doesn t help  and explains why these companies are popular   unfortunately we are bombarded with society s ideals of male sexuality in the media  which create unrealistic expectations of how a man should look and perform in the bedroom  these advertisements prey on the insecurities of men who often have no sexual dysfunction at all   inexperienced young men who have received most of their sex education by looking at porn are most affected  they see professional actors with porn-star bodies perform unrealistic fantasy sex - with a rock-hard penis - lasting for a very long time  it s no surprise that for some men all these expectations can damage their confidence   one of my clients was a 19-year-old young man who met a girl he really liked and wanted to make sure he would be a good lover  he d had some flings with girls before  but he was worried that he only lasted for about 10 minutes  when i explained that the  average  ejaculation time is between three and seven minutes  he could hardly believe it  he thought it should be at least 20 minutes because some of his  mates  told him they could last for half an hour or more  he left my office with a confident big smile on his face   premature ejaculation  pe  is a condition that about 30 per cent of the male population suffer from  at some time in their lives  often it s not physical but psychological - inexperience and worry can cause performance anxiety  when a man anticipates problems about his performance  it can become a self-fulfilling fear and it s not unusual to also start losing erections   however  there are men who always ejaculate within two minutes and would like to last longer  the earliest treatment for pe was the start-stop method a way of learning ejaculatory control that still remains popular  a study presented at the european association of urology congress in stockholm  last year  showed that pelvic floor exercises can help improve ejaculation time  this is a helpful link to the mayo clinic s kegel exercises sheet       many men develop pe as a result of constantly hurrying to finish masturbation when they were young  often because of guilt or shame  or worry about lack of privacy in case parents  siblings or room-mates  caught them in the act   masturbation should be enjoyed and be a source of pleasure  so change your masturbation pattern and find the privacy you need to enjoy your time alone  disappointing or bad experiences with former partners can also cause anxiety and will make it difficult to relax   another treatment option involves applying a desensitising cream or a topical lidocaine-based spray  such as the us food and drug administration approved promescent  which has few side effects  the spray lotion is rubbed into the skin of the penis until it is completely absorbed  about 10 minutes before sexual activity  for men who use condoms durex has the performa and extended pleasure condoms  which contain lubricant with the anaesthetic benzocaine  last year a new medication entered the market called priligy  which is taken 30 minutes before intercourse and lasts for up to four hours      some doctors treat pe with a daily dose of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors  ssris  the most commonly prescribed antidepressants  used to treat clinical depression  serotonin has a depressant effect on sexual response  which means one side-effect is delayed orgasm  one of my clients tried it for six months and was disappointed  he lasted a bit longer sexually but suffered badly from several side-effects of the drug  anyway  why prescribe a perfectly healthy young man anti-depressants  when there are so many other treatments available    so what do women want   in my experience  very few women care much about the length of the sex session  instead  they want more focus on foreplay  connection  pleasure  intimacy and emotional closeness   sometimes intercourse can become painful when it takes too long  many perfectly normal women don t produce much vaginal lubrication  so it s important to always use enough lubricant   women need more time to get aroused  they like their men to give good oral sex and know where to find and how to stimulate the clitoris to give them an orgasm   so if anything should last longer  it should be foreplay   matty silver is a

pierre casiraghi leave their religious ceremony on saturday  photo  instagram armani  monacan royal pierre casiraghi  has married beatrice borromeo  in a two-weekend  two-country wedding extravaganza   the 27-year-old royal tied the knot with the italian journalist and aristocrat in a civil ceremony at his palace in monaco last week  followed by a religious ceremony at her family s italian estate on saturday   the pair met while at university in milan seven years ago  which sounds suspiciously like how a certain other royal married couple first met   however  the similarities end there because  while the 2011 british royal wedding was lovely  there were a few ways in which pierre and beatrice had will and kate beat   1  the dress es   the duchess of cambridge s alexander mcqueen number was obviously fantastic  but why wear just one couture gown when you can wear three   during her week of wedding celebrations  borromeo took the opportunity to wear three separate wedding dresses   at her civil ceremony last week  the former model wore a pale pink chiffon and gold lace number from valentino  who also dressed her sisters for their respective weddings   this was followed up with a custom-made ivory armani gown during her religious ceremony on saturday and  because you can t mix designers on the same day  she wore another custom-made armani dress for the reception  with two family heirloom diamond brooches pinned on the train   2  crowd control  everyone wants a piece of a royal wedding  for the duke and duchess of cambridge  that meant their guest list included everyone from the sultan of brunei to the beckhams   both coming from aristocratic families - and both being quite well known on the european social scene - borromeo and casiraghi managed to amass 700 people who needed to be present on their big day  but  did they expect 700 people to sit through three events  no way   the newlyweds went with a classic  tiered  invitation system  only inviting close friends and family to the religious ceremony  while allowing the guest list to billow out at the civil ceremony and reception  which is probably the bit they actually wanted to attend  anyway    3  location  westminster abbey is nice  but it s no private island   borromeo and casiraghi s religious ceremony was held on isolino di san giovanni   one of the borromean islands on italy s lake maggiore  the borromean islands have been in the bride s family since the early 16th century and would have been lovely to sail your boat around on a sunny italian weekend had the borromeo family not ordered that no one could come within 500 metres of isolino di san giovanni on their girl s special day    oh  and the ceremony last week was at the prince s palace in monaco  which isn t too shabby

sport  not necessarily   we stretch to lengthen out tight muscles  enhance performance and repair injured tissues   right   not necessarily   we re stretching for all the wrong reasons  science writer beth skwarecki says in a new feature    in many cases  stretching does the opposite of what it s promoted for   skwarecki says   you already know that it doesn t prevent injuries     it also doesn t cure muscle soreness  in fact  aggressive stretching can cause muscle soreness  and pre-workout stretches  far from preparing you to work out  actually rob you of strength    it is the opposite of what we ve been taught about stretching  so what is the truth   in a series of studies from 2002  professor rob herbert  a researcher fellow with neuroscience research australia  found that stretching reduced the likelihood of soreness by less than 2 per cent and that stretching reduced the likelihood of experiencing a sports injury by about 1 per cent     available evidence suggests there s probably very small reductions in soreness   herbert says  noting reduction in injury risk is  trivially small     that s pretty well recognised now   physiocise executive director anna-louise bouvier says of stretching s minimal impact on soreness   it is the same story with injury  she says  in fact  stretching can actually create injury    when you re well warmed up  there s the tendency to stretch too far   bouvier explains   even without overdoing it  stretching can damage muscle fibres    you re just tearing them by stretching them instead of by contracting them   skwarecki says     if you want to stop feeling sore  aggressive stretching is the last thing you d want to do    because muscle pulls  strains  feel similar to soreness  people often have the same reaction  wanting to stretch the pulled muscle  here it s an even worse idea  the pulled muscle needs to knit back together  and stretching sabotages that process    interestingly  the tearing involved in stretching can make us stronger in the long term    if weightlifting and stretching can both cause muscle damage  they should both cause the muscles to repair themselves stronger than they started   skwarecki explains   stretching does cause hypertrophy – muscle growth – and this seems to explain why people who stretch end up stronger over time    in the short term however  stretching decreases our strength    imagine a catapult   bouvier says   when the arc is shorter you re going to be able to generate more force    when it s stretched out though  the  arc  lacks force   for this reason  stretching can hinder our performance say  if we do it right before we lift weights or need to perform an activity requiring explosive power    it s the most complicated   herbert says   it hasn t been rigorously tested  it may improve performance in some things and it definitely does decrease performance in certain things     but  perhaps the most surprising truth about stretching is that it doesn t lengthen our muscles  at least  the effect doesn t last in the short term  bouvier says   if we stretch for years  however  and also build strength to support our newly elongated muscles  it might be a different story  hello yoga  pilates and ballet   but  if stretching isn t doing the things we think  what exactly is the point   herbert points out one limitation of many stretching studies to date    all these studies have looked at five months   he says   not five years    he doesn t stretch himself and hasn t stretched before sport for 20 years  since he started his research into the subject   his take on stretching is   if it feels nice  do it    and for many of us  the fact that stretching feels so good is point enough    it can relieve a lot of muscle spasms and as a short-term relief can feel beautiful   bouvier says  noting that flexible  floppy  folk do it intuitively    for those who find stretching tough   stiffys  as she calls them  it s all the more reason to do it    the body needs stretching and strengthening   she says   stiffys hate stretching but should do quite a lot of it  floppys need to work more on strength   this  she adds  is an oversight  too often missed in studies  not all bodies and not all muscles are the same    they say  this applies to all bodies  but we should say  this applies to some bodies    bouvier says   basically what you hate is often what you really need    while stretching may or may not lengthen muscles in the long term  perhaps it returns them to their original supple state  after years of contraction and sitting stiffly at desks    maybe not their original supple state   bouvier says   more like putting a bit of leather rejuvenator on an old handbag … softens them    another possible point is the positive effect stretching has on fascia  the connective tissue that surrounds our muscles   few studies have been done  but it s a promising area of research     it is full of nerve receptors and while we don t totally understand how it is involved it s definitely the next horizon in  releasing  tension   bouvier says   fascia is especially important if the muscle has spasmed due to pain or protection     certain specific stretches especially  bigger  stretches are great for releasing fascial chains and also feel fantastic but the long-term ramifications and underlying reasons for that are still not 100 per cent clear    we might be stretching for the wrong reasons  but that doesn t mean there aren t still excellent reasons to stretch it out  why you re probably an ambivert  an ambivert  most of us are   i d say i m an introvert  except i m not  exactly   i sometimes avoid people that i like and in social settings often prefer to sit back and observe   i enjoy being on my own and have to work hard to overcome inherent shyness when i meet new people   that said  i love socialising and struggle without seeing friends regularly   so what does that make me   most likely  like about two-thirds of the population  i m an ambivert   we exhibit both introverted and extroverted  or extraverted  as some call it  qualities and sit on a spectrum rather than exclusively at one end   we re flexible  we re mercurial  and there is a label for our fluid nature    ambiverts are like goldilocks – they offer neither too much nor too little   adam grant  an organisational psychologist and professor of psychology at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  told wall street journal    they re not overly extraverted   says new york times best-selling author daniel pink   they re not overly introverted  they re a little of both    psychologist hans eysenck   who coined the term  ambivert  in 1947  says ambiverts bridge the gap between the hypersensitivity of some introverts and the overbearing nature of some extroverts   but  ambiverts can be pains in the proverbial butt of predictability  this is because we don t always know what we want and because how we feel shifts  it can be hard to know how to handle certain situations   introverts tend to know that taking time to retreat from social situations restores them  extroverts  on the contrary  are energised by interacting and connecting with others   ambiverts  who knows  it depends on the day   sometimes we want nothing more than a drink with a mate  other times  curling up on the couch alone is all you crave    if you are aware that you can go both ways  then you can look at a situation and see what behaviours are going to be most effective and rewarding   laurie helgoe   author of introvert power  why your inner life is your hidden strength told wall street journal   there is no right or wrong personality type  but knowing our tendencies can help us work to our strengths and understand how to energise ourselves   for ambiverts  this will mean different things at different times    the ambivert advantage stems from the tendency to be assertive and enthusiastic enough     but at the same time  listening carefully     and avoiding the appearance of being overly confident or excited   grant has said    he says we re at our best when we don t attempt to pigeonhole ourselves into one way of feeling or behaving  rather  he suggests   unleashing your inner ambivert     read each situation more carefully   he says   and ask yourself   what do i need to do right now to be most happy or successful     speaker  author and coach beth buelow describes typical behaviours to wall street journal   the ambivert  socially flexible – comfortable in social situations or

matter  photo  supplied  casual sex has always been around but over recent decades it has become much more common and accepted   in the 1950s the arrival of the birth control pill led to a sexual revolution and a dramatic shift in traditional values  such as increased acceptance of sex outside marriage and having casual sex with strangers   the fact that young people marry or settle down much later than their parents did also mean they usually had many more partners  in australia there hasn t been much research done yet on our casual sex habits or  the more popular term   hook-up  culture   in the us however  sex researcher dr zhana vrangalova from cornell university  led a nine-month research study of 370 university students about their sexual feelings  behaviour and overall wellbeing  they were questioned about their views on casual sex  how many people they had casual sex with and their levels of sexual desire  about 42 per cent who participated and enjoyed casual sex reported higher self-esteem and lower rates of depression   according to vrangalova  this study seems to suggest that casual sex can be a good thing for people who are open to it  desire it  and have positive attitudes towards it   but she added that safe sex and not being  too drunk  could be key to not regretting a one-night stand  check out her interesting tedex video – is casual sex bad for you  – which was published last month   dr vrangalova  who is now adjunct professor at the new york university psychology department  decided to set up the casual sex project to learn more about hooking-up  the project is a website where participants can share true stories of casual sex experiences of all kinds – one-night stands  short flings  sex buddies  friends-with-benefits  etc – as long as sex is involved with someone they are not in a serious relationship with  she hopes the project will not only encourage sexually expressive people to reveal their erotic secrets  but will provide people who don t choose to engage in casual sex with an insight into a more sexually fluid world   it s not much different in australia where casual sex has also become the norm among both young and older people  the young are experimenting and many older people who have separated or divorced are wanting to enjoy life for a while  the many dating websites are proof of this   one of my clients had been in a serious relationship for five years with a partner who was her first lover  when they split up and she moved out she didn t want a new boyfriend again  she wasn t ready yet and she wanted to enjoy being single for a while and have casual sex  she saw me just for one session to get some  sex education  as she felt quite insecure   some people believe casual sex relationships are easy and have no complications  but sex is loaded with emotions and often you can receive mixed messages  especially after having sex which leaves you ecstatic for days  this can be a problem if the partner is not interested in romance or commitment  it s really important to set strict rules before starting a casual relationship to avoid disappointment and heartache  another important issue is alcohol – often people regret or feel guilty about a sexual encounter after drinking too much – or not using a condom   nowadays with the rise of smart phones around the world  mobile dating apps have sprung up  using gps technology to match singles with others who are close by  one of the first was grindr in 2009  which promoted easy hook-ups and was used almost exclusively by gay men  at the time the consensus was that women wouldn t use dating apps in quite the same way  but in 2011 blendr  which mimics the format of grindr  was launched and became soon popular with straight daters   one of the most successful dating apps in australia is tinder  which is used almost as much by women as by men  tinder s technology allows people to use their mobile phone to browse profile photos of other tinder users within a set geographical distance  it also links to facebook  which shows a lot more information   not everyone using tinder is looking for casual sex  for some it is a more convenient and easier way of meeting potential partners  it is also helpful for people who have busy lives  instead of going out to a bar  they can connect and find people to chat to without leaving home  i m told it can become very addictive   casual sex can be a good thing for people who are open to it  like it and have a positive attitude towards it   but when it comes to sex  you should only do whatever works for you   matty silver is a relationship counsellor and sex therapist study identifies  mean drunk  personality type  know a  mean drunk   it might not have anything to do with how much they drink  photo  getty  ever been told you re a  mean drunk   it might not have anything to do with how much you drink   a united states study has identified four different types of drunks  ranging from the pollyanna who shouts everyone kebabs at the end of the night  right through to the person who thinks a social gathering is the perfect place to tell you they think you ve gained weight  however  they did not find any correlation between how much someone drank and their drunk personality   the study  published in addiction research   theory  asked 187 pairs of college students who regularly drank together what their bar buddy was like when they re drunk  in comparison to when they re sober   participants rated their friend on the basis of five personality traits  openness  conscientiousness  extraversion  agreeableness  and neuroticism   based on their answers  researchers from the university of missouri categorised drinkers into four personality types  which they really did give these names  who said science was boring    there was the ernest hemingway  who had an even temperament and exhibited all five traits while sober  their temperament did not change remarkably after the consumption of alcohol  the mary poppins scored highly on agreeableness  and continued to do so when drunk  the nutty professor became less conscientious and much more open after a few drinks  and the mr hyde became less conscientious and agreeable after a night at the pub   no correlation was found between the excessive consumption of alcohol and membership of any particular personality type   unsurprisingly  those who turned into dr jekyll s dark alter-ego experienced the most problems with their drinking   participants in this group were more likely to have experienced  consequences  relating to the consumption of alcohol  examples of which included receiving a lower mark on an exam or engaging in regrettable sexual behaviours   the hemingway group were the second-most likely group to have experienced such consequences  followed by the nutty professors and the  practically perfect  mary poppins type   interestingly  the mr hyde group contained more women than any of the other categories   researchers noted that more studies with a larger and more diverse sample  the 347 students were overwhelmingly young  white americans  are needed before definite conclusions about drunken personality types can be drawn the best age to get married  is preventing divorce simply a matter of getting married at the right time  photo  getty  your grandparents probably think it was five years ago  but when is the best age to get married   according to a recently published us study  it s when you re not too young  but you re not too old either   the study  undertaken by university of utah sociologist nick wolfinger  and published by the  socially conservative  institute of family studies  found that people who were married between the ages of 28 and 32 were least likely to get divorced within the first five years of marriage   controlling for variables such as respondents  sex  race  family structure of origin  age at the time of the survey  education  religious tradition  religious attendance  sexual history whether they had a child prior to getting married  and the size of their hometown when undertaking his research  wolfinger analysed data from the us national survey of family growth to pinpoint the ideal age for people to tie the knot   in doing so  he created what slate has termed the  goldilocks theory  of marriage  the need to find that  just right  age in order to have a lasting relationship   however  not everyone agrees with wolfinger s research   in response to the study  university of maryland sociologist philip cohen conducted his own analysis analysing the – much larger – american community survey  and found that  in the case of women in their first marriages  the older the bride   the less likely the couple is to divorce   this result is consistent with the findings in cohen s 2014 paper  recession and divorce in the united states  2008-2011   according to the australian bureau of statistics  in 2013 the median age at marriage was 31 5 years for men and 29 5 years for women   in 2013  there were 47 638 divorces granted in australia  a decrease of 2279  4 6 per cent  from 2012   the median age at

the girl outside   the toddler s mother tara carson described the encounter in a post on the diner s facebook page  calling the owner an  absolute lunatic  who  screamed in the face of my almost two year old    neugebauer responded to the facebook post with a profanity-filled comment   darla s diner in portland  maine  photo  google streetview   you are lucky i didn t get really f---ing nuts

courtesy of others   she continued  before listing the day s specials  which included a chocolate cream pie and a  wafflewich    the scene is reminiscent of public outrage over cafe policies regarding young children in australian eateries    the owner of a french cafe in newcastle sparked fierce debate last year after her response to a snarky one-star customer review that criticised the venue for not being child-friendly   but sydney cafe managers say there is no excuse for yelling at a child    we don t have any written protocol  but we would never yell at children  it s a pretty irresponsible way to act   the manager of maisy s cafe in neutral bay  who did not want to be named  said    if there s ever any trouble we d quietly ask the parents to look after their kids     the management of the leichhardt restaurant bar italia pulls out all the stops to accommodate families with young children    we love  em  we re a very kid friendly place  we ve got ice cream and bubble gum up the front  of the restaurant  and kids can run amuck in the backyard   bar italia owner con damouras said   he described a recent incident involving a family with a crying child    a couple of regular customer had a go at them and my partner went up and told them to  leave them alone  the kids are just kids  and managed to calm the situation   he said    it happens  but there s usually a way to fix the problem  we re all adults  the problem with having one child  we thought people would respect our choice but having an only child seems to be the one subject still open to discrimination   only the lonely  is having one child selfish   after we have our first kid  my husband plans on getting the snip  making our first kid  our last   what s so wrong with that  plenty  apparently    having just one child is child abuse    you ll regret it forever    you re both being selfish    the kid won t know how to share    you re dooming your baby to a lifetime of loneliness    think of what you re missing out on    why would you deliberately destroy you chance of a happy family   and  finally  the verdict given in a tone of resignation   well  at least a vasectomy can be reversed …   i knew once we made the decision to jump on board the baby train  we d be riding into a place loaded with judgment and scorn  i expected people to have firm views about whether hospital or home deliveries were best  we were prepared to have our views  and my body  poked and prodded  by people with best intentions  and those who professed to  but we weren t ready for how people would handle our response to the query about whether we wanted a boy or a girl    well  we re only planning on one  so it doesn t matter – so long as it s healthy    cue shock  awe  disbelief  disdain  from perfect strangers  from acquaintances  and from people who know us very well  some offered their support  but reserved their right to approve  some were mute and baffled  only a very  very few people endorsed our decision  or said they were of the same mind  or spoke from their own experience  we had thought people would respect that the choice was ours to make  but for the majority  this was not the case  in this age of political correctness  it seems the one subject still subject to discrimination is that of the only child   were we missing something  fertility rates are falling in australia  people are having smaller families  birth can be controlled  women are working  diversity is flourishing  individualism is celebrated  plus  climate change is a big concern and overpopulation a big part of the problem  given all this  you d think the choice of one child would get a thumbs-up  but no  ours did not  blindsided by the negativity  we started to question our planned path  perhaps we weren t making the right choice  for the right reasons after all  maybe we should heed the tut-tuts of those people who said   oh  just you wait  you ll change your mind   would we come to regret a decision made about parenthood before we were parents ourselves  were there many good reasons our decision was seen as such a bad one    no  there aren t   says an economist friend of mine   kids aren t reasonable decisions  they aren t rational choices  not in contemporary  comfortable australia anyway  if they were  no one would have them  because  frankly  they don t make economic sense   not like back when you needed more hands to help around pastoral houses  till soil and so forth  then  kids were labour  now they re more about love  kids are a want  not a need   it s true in my case   he continues   i knew that having a third child didn t  add up   but we went ahead and had one anyway  it was about satisfying our desire  not about making sense    this goes some way to explaining the emotional tone of some people s reaction  for them  not having more children was akin to not loving children  a fault that  in the eyes of many  colours me a deeper shade of bad than my husband  for the glowing mantle of goodly motherhood still hangs heavy around the waists of australian women  rejecting it  even for very good reasons  is still a rockier road to walk than that traditional trip through the fertile fields of beautiful  bountiful  breeding  a shame  in view of the fact some women never get to make a choice about motherhood  furthermore  our society is supposed to be more open-minded than that  we re not supposed to believe a woman s place is at the hearth  in the home  preferably barefoot and pregnant anymore  we don t have to be fruitful and multiply if we don t want to   yet abandoning those old patriarchal christian ideals seems to be a lot harder for australians to do than we realise  you only need look as far as the gay marriage debate to see that the big old book still sits like a weight on the collective psyche  it s true that some people oppose our choice because they believe in big families  because they believe in god  for them  our decision to stop at one is more than a personal affront to the way they ve decided to live  it s also a sin  was jesus an only child  hasn t the pope asked catholics to cool their procreative jets    this divide has reached screamy proportions in the united states  where the word  family  has come to mean  big   and conservatives claim they ll inherit the earth after the liberals literally die out due to their  contracepted  lives  are we at that point down under  i m not sure   what i am sure of is that many studies disprove many of the myths associated with only children  dr toni falbo   of the university of texas at austin  trawled through a century s worth of scholarship to reveal  in a book called the single-child family  that single children are not disadvantaged  she followed that up with studies of her own on the so-called  little emperors  of china s one-child policy  she found the spoiled brat stereotype was false   it s important to note that  overall  the differences between only children and other children were very slight   falbo says in this 2004 interview   factors like education level of the parents  the financial state of the family  emotional health and values of the parents  individual parenting styles and the genetic predisposition of the child have far  far more to do with how a child turns out than birth order and family size    one child for us is a considered choice  one made for many reasons  we know we can love one child deeply  we can provide for one child very well  we are lucky to live in a city filled with family and friends  the child will not be isolated  the child will not be alone  the child will have a happy home  our child is due in january  and  baby  the kid s gonna be ok   ok   katherine feeney is a journalist with the nine network australia are you a head person or a heart person your life depends on the answer  learning what role the  heart  plays when making decisions can help us to be more effective   are you a head person or a heart person   your answer to this question may offer more insight into you and your decision-making process than you might think   it s common sense that those who follow their heart are more emotional and tend to make decisions based on their intuition  while those who use their head are cooler and more rational    irrespective of sex differences  head-locators characterised themselves as rational  logical  and interpersonally cold  whereas heart-locators characterised themselves as emotional  feminine  and interpersonally warm   wrote the authors of a 2013 study  published in the journal of personality and social psychology  they also found  head  people tended to be better at answering general knowledge questions  perform better academically and be less emotionally reactive to stress   there is the tendency for head folk though to over analyse   take head-case classic  albert einstein    if i had an hour to solve a problem  i would spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes about the solution   he once said   heart people however  are more likely to make instant decisions based on their intuition and feel happier with that call in the long run   the influence of head or heart on who we are and how we make choices extends to major life decisions   a series of tests to see how we react differently to life s big moral dilemmas reveal how dependent that choice is on whether we re operating from our hearts or our heads    people who said their  self  was located in their heart  about half the respondents  were more likely to be female  and  heart-locators  of either sex were more likely to rely on their emotions when making hypothetical moral decisions  such as how to respond to a sadistic prison guard who says he will kill your son and another prisoner unless you kill your own son   explains dr christian jarrett of the british psychological society s research digest     in this situation  heart-locators were more likely than  head-locators  to say they d refuse to kill their own son – the more emotional and  in the specific circumstances  less rational choice because they were effectively condemning two people to die rather than one    expanding on this research  a new study has found  heart  people are more likely to define death as when a person s heart stops beating  while for  head  people death occurs when the brain stops functioning   additionally  the researchers found head people tended to be more independent  and identify with terms like  me  and  i  whereas  heart  people had more of a sense of interdependence with others and identified with terms like  we  and  our    if you had a  head  person use  we  and  our  in phrases however  they were more likely to identify it as coming from the heart  similarly   heart  people felt more like they were using their heads when they used the words  i  and  me    what s the point of knowing all of this    it s consistent with other findings suggesting we all have particular biases in our thinking styles and decision making processes   says dr tim sharp of the happiness institute   in the worst case scenarios this can be seen in racism or sexism  but it s not entirely bad and it is very common  in lesser ways      being aware of our biases can help us to make better decisions  sharp says    understanding and acknowledging our own idiosyncrasies  in this context  in our thinking and decision making  can help us to temper the potentially negative consequences and in many cases  help us to make better  more balanced or helpful decisions   he explains     so in short  the value of knowing whether we re a  head  or a  heart  person is in choosing whether or not we want to go with our primary response  which we don t always have to    pausing with awareness can give us the chance to gather our head with our heart so that we can make well-rounded and potentially more effective calls     if we can understand that our first response isn t always the right response  although it might be some times    sharp says   we can then learn to weigh up alternatives and hopefully  more often than not  choose the best one for that particular situation  does your dog need vitamin pills  should fido take his fish oil when you do   according to 2012 data from the australian bureau of statistics  29 per cent of australians take at least one dietary supplement each day   dubbed  nutraceuticals   nutritional pharmaceuticals  these complementary medicines range from fish oil to vitamin tablets  and are increasingly becoming a part of the average australian s diet   but now nutraceuticals aren t just being given to kids who are fussy eaters  or guiltily consumed by adults who struggle to eat a balanced diet  they re being fed to pets   pet nutraceuticals come in broadly two types  supplements designed to make up for poor diet and other nutraceuticals which are designed to target particular health problems a pet might be having   it might sound like overkill  but with the average australian dog costing over  2400 a year to keep the pet owner s aren t exactly averse to spending on their pet s wellbeing   in 2010  australian natural healthcare brand blackmores launched pure animal wellbeing  paw   a nutraceuticals range for pets    much like people  modern dogs  are living longer and many are living in cities in apartments and exposed to more pollution and spend less time outside   a blackmores spokesperson told fairfax media     today s dogs also face challenges because their  pet parents  are often working long hours  so they may not get the company or the opportunity to exercise as much as they would like    according to blackmores  these stresses most commonly manifest themselves in joint problems  which affect up to 70 per cent of some larger dog breeds  as a result  the brand s joint care range  such as sulfate  joint health chews   are the brand s most popular products   alleviating joint pain is also where the bulk of the research into the affects of nutraceuticals on pets has been conducted  with a 2009 finnish study finding evidence that green-lipped mussel could improve the condition of a dog suffering from canine osteoporosis   but dr david neck  a spokesman for the australian veterinary association  is not convinced    the science behind  studies which support pet nutraceuticals  is often vague with little data   he says    the 2009 study above studied 45 dogs  however  it concluded that  although green-lipped mussel did provide some benefit  it was not as effective as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs    as for the role that nutraceuticals can play in supplementing dietary requirements  dr neck is skeptical about the benefit vitamin pills would have in the majority of dogs   alarmingly  dr neck says if your dog is being fed a high quality dog food  trying to supplement their dietary intake could actually do more harm than good    generally speaking  any commercial diet labelled  balanced and complete  doesn t need anything more added   dr neck says    in fact in many instances supplementing commercial diets can upset their balance and isn t recommended    the only kind of diets which dr neck believes could benefit from vitamin supplements are home-made diets  which he ultimately says should only be attempted by owners who have read a book on pet nutrition  or discussed their proposed food plan with their pet s vet    some pets are just not suited to anything other than a perfectly balanced diet  sleep deprivation  as bad as smoking   sleepless nights  the precursor to an array of problems  photo  simon schluter  people who boast about getting by on less than five hours sleep should be shunned like smokers  because of the harm which can be caused by short sleeping  a leading professor has said   professor russell foster  a neuroscientist from the university of oxford  said lack of sleep is damaging to health  with too many early risers trying to function with brain skills so damaged they could be drunk   the comments follow studies which suggest that working night shifts speeds up the ageing process  and is linked to increasing risks of cancer  heart disease and type two diabetes   professor foster  director of the sleep and circadian neuroscience institute  called for a change in attitudes towards getting an early night    there certainly is a culture of  well i only had five hours of sleep last night how fantastic am i   he said   in fact  we should be looking down on those sort of things - in the same way that we frown upon smoking i think we should start to frown upon not taking our sleep seriously    the neuroscientist raised concern that sleep deprivation could cause risks not just in jobs such as healthcare and transport  where dangers were obvious  but also could damage the quality of crucial decisions    we see this too much with really senior people   he said   lack of sleep damages a whole host of skills - empathy  processing information  ability to handle people  but right at the top of the chain you get overly impulsive  impaired thinking  because of this problem     look at banking  look at the recent decisions about the greek crisis   he said   we see major discussions going through the night which have a massive impact  and decisions are being made when skills are very impaired   he said many of those who rise before dawn were unaware of just how badly it could affect the functioning of their brain    at four o clock in the morning our ability to process information is similar to the amount of alcohol that would make us legally drunk – as bad as if we had a few whiskies or beers   he said   professor foster said the evidence about the increased health risks posed by nightshifts was compelling    the assumption has always been that you adapt to the nightshift that the body clock will map on to the demands of working at night  the really extraordinary findings across a whole range of different studies are that you don t adapt   he said  citing research linking night working to a host of diseases   but he said overall lack of rest was enough to cause lack of attention  accidental  microsleeps  - such as dropping off at the wheel - as well as reduced ability to process thoughts   last year french research showed the brains of workers who had done night shifts for about 10 years had aged by an extra 6 and a half years   those taking part in the study by the university of toulouse  found they had lower scores for memory  processing speed and overall brain function than those working normal office hours   lack of sleep has been linked with factors such as disrupted metabolism and raised levels of the  stress hormone  cortisol  all of which may lead to higher blood pressure and increased stroke risk   in 2010 a major study found that people who slept for less than six hours each night were 12 per cent more likely to die prematurely - before the age of 65 - than those who slept the recommended six to eight hours a night   the team from the university of warwick and federico ii university medical school in naples analysed 16 studies involving a total of 1 3 million people   but sleeping too much has also been linked with ill-health  and an increased risk of early death   studies have found that sleep makes it easier to retrieve nuggets of information that may have got lost in a corner of our brain   in two situations where subjects forgot information over the course of 12 hours of being awake  after a night s sleep they were about twice as likely to be able to remember it  the university of exeter study found   sleep habits of those at the top  as prime minister  margaret thatcher famously slept for just four hours a

weird way he just styled his hair why the lonely stay lost in loneliness  not alone  one third of australians feel lonely   we crave connection and yet it is all too easy to stay lost in loneliness   about one third of australians suffer from the sorrow of loneliness   the deep ache of loneliness doesn t just affect us emotionally   it has a very real impact on our physical health   so much so that a new study of three million people has found that loneliness is as much of a threat to longevity as obesity    the effect of this is comparable to obesity  something that public health takes very seriously   said the study s author julianne holt-lunstad  of brigham young university   we need to start taking our social relationships more seriously    the irony is that  just as much as we can be alone without feeling lonely  we can feel lonely even if we re not alone   superficial connections  looking at our phones instead of each other and living in a largely online world where functionality and efficiency reign over friendliness and any depth of engagement  all mean we can have others around externally and still feel internally isolated   interestingly  those who feel lonely are no less socially adept than those who don t   if this is the case  why do the lonely remain lonely   another new study  lead by psychologists at franklin   marshall college found that lonely people have equal social skills  but struggle when put under pressure to utilise them   the researchers asked 86 undergraduates identify the emotions of faces displaying  anger  fear  happiness  or sadness   those who  in a previous questionnaire  had rated themselves as being more lonely were worse at accurately identifying the emotions  but only when they were told it was a test of their social skills  and that people who failed at this task tended to have difficulty forming and maintaining friendships   previous studies have found similar results  suggesting that like anything that is really important to us  we want it to be perfect and become so stiff with fear about getting it wrong that we mess it up    this research suggests that lonely individuals may not need to acquire social skills to escape loneliness  instead  they must learn to cope with performance anxiety in interpersonal interactions   the authors wrote   in a separate test  she told them that their social performance anxiety was just jitters from a caffeinated drink they had been given  which didn t actually contain caffeine    the second time around  when only the lonely thought there was another reason for their feelings  they performed as well as the others   this suggests that as much as it is a matter of creating opportunities for real connection with others  addressing loneliness may also be about addressing anxiety   because if our experience is that we inadvertently sabotage our chance to connect through self-doubt  then we are likely to retreat even more or begin to feel that genuine connections are unlikely or even impossible   the second part of the franklin   marshall study  offers the possibility of an antidote to this problem  as new york magazine points out   reframing an experience can lead to a different outcome  as harvard business school s alison wood brooks has found    individuals can reappraise anxiety as excitement using minimal strategies such as self-talk  eg  saying  i am excited  out loud  or simple messages  eg   get excited    which lead them to feel more excited  adopt an opportunity mindset  as opposed to a threat mindset   and improve their subsequent performance   she wrote of a study designed to help people overcome public speaking   there are many ways to reconnect with others when we become lost in loneliness  we can falter in these because we care  so perhaps the place to start is to step out of the head s fear and back into reality  where those connections can be made   lonely people  after all  already have the social skills to make those connections happen is it best to dress casually on a first date there s something about tessa  tessa meets the bachelor  sam wood  still in her formal attire    the first episode of the bachelor is kind of like year 10 formal pre-drinks at an all-girls high school where every girl in the group decided not to bring a date but  surprise   one decided at the last minute to bring their older cousin who s down from cairns   the male female ratio is like federal cabinet in reverse  there are more sequins than at an under-10s dance eisteddfod  and the girl who cries  you can bet someone will cry  will mess up their eyelash glue and end up looking like a well spray-tanned dali   last night s premiere of the third season of the bachelor australia seemed to be no exception  until one contestant decided she d spent long enough looking like she was about to attend the oscars   tessa  left  debuts her new look    i don t feel comfortable in what i m wearing   tessa  the 33-year-old account manager from victoria  announced to the group  before sneaking away with the encouragement of fellow contestant heather   when she returned  tessa was wearing a singlet top  ripped jeans and a pair of timberlands  with a red flannelette shirt tied around her waist    meet tessa the lumberjack   heather jokingly announced  before tessa decided to go show the man of the hour her new look   the  i bachelor  i  contestants  with tessa centre    i don t do glitz   tessa said  casually interrupting the bachelor s conversation with fellow contestant bec    i m not a glitz guy   bachelor sam wood replied    why is she cutting in on me and why is she wearing casual clothing   poor bec confusedly offered  presenting the latter offence as somehow more depraved than the former   she has a point  why would a woman wear  casual clothing  when a floor-length gown was an option   isn t it simply an unwritten  also  oft-written  rule that women are at their most physically impressive when they look ready to hit a red carpet   not true  says elaine george  a sexologist  lecturer and researcher who is doing a phd on male sexual desire  at the university of sydney   in her research  george has found men aren t inherently attracted to women who are  dressed up to the nines  or wearing conventionally  sexy  clothing    what men really love is when women are in their natural state   she says    i don t think men like artificiality  whether that s through make-up  or stilettos  or clothing that s meant to impress other women    george says many men have moved past equating flashing skin with sexiness    we ve moved beyond an era where the more cleavage a woman displays  the better  or the more  mini  the skirt is  the better    although she didn t watch last night s episode  george says that if tessa was making a clothing choice that allowed her to express her personality  her  natural femininity and strength of character would have shone through    psychologist and personal coach melanie schilling agrees that dressing up for a date isn t necessarily the right choice for every woman   she says that  when dressing for a first date  which  in a kind of abstract  nightmarish way  the first episode of the bachelor is   women should keep their  dating goal  in mind    are you dating to gather a range of interesting and casual encounters or to develop a deep  meaningful connection    once you know what you want from the date  you can decide how to dress to reflect this   schilling says colour choices are a powerful weapon here  a 2008 study from the university of rochester found that red enhanced men s attraction to women  while cooler colours should be worn by those who want to give off long-term relationship vibes   but the tone the clothing projects is also important    dress according to who you want to be in your ultimate relationship    so  did tessa commit the cardinal sin of dating by breaking out the flanno last night   well  she came home with a rose  so  maybe a lumberjack romance is exactly what the bachelor is after  i ve decided to marry myself  same-self marriage  just married  to yourself   they say you find happiness in marriage  that s why everyone should have the right to get married  but some people say that they don t need marriage to be happy  others say that marriage was the root of their misery  the point is  marriage is an idea we can all relate to  one that is rapidly being redefined  but i heard a new story about marriage recently that really made me think    i ve decided to get married to myself    so said a very dear friend of mine at a dinner party  she d tried the traditional model  and enjoyed bits of it  especially the children  but ultimately  she was left wanting  post divorce she tried dating  and thought about cohabitating without walking down another aisle  but decided it wasn t for her  past mid-life  with a new job  a house of her own  and nothing tying her down  she reasoned now was the time to really enjoy the person she d spent half her life with  and was destined to be with forever  herself   fans of tv shows sex and the city will know this idea is not new  in one episode  main-character carrie decides to do the same  but her motive is slightly different  one pair of her many  500-a-pair shoes are stolen at a friend s baby shower  when she asks the mother-to-be for compensation  the friend shames carrie for her lavish taste   we can t afford that carrie  we have bills to pay and a family to feed   in response  the single-gal sick of having to spend money on other people matriculating through the mainstream ceremonial milestones like engagements  marriage and childbirth  decides on a  can t-beat- em  join- em  approach   that night  i decided i couldn t wait for a ring  and so  i gave someone else one    this is mylo  this is allegra  mommie and daddie and baby henry and us aren t here  leave a message     hi  it s carrie bradshaw  i wanted to let you know that i m getting married  to myself  i m registered at manolo blahnik   so thanks  bye    one giant step for me  one small step for single woman kind   a woman s right to shoes    a step  sure  though not quite in the same direction as my friend s  as carrie s desire for self-marriage seems to be more motivated by well-heeled capitalist greed than the pursuit of self-sustaining happiness  however  my mate does admit to wanting a ceremony   more to legitimise my decision in the eyes of people i love and respect than anything else   she says   for me  it s not about getting pressies i may otherwise miss out on by not keeping to convention  it s about recognising one of the hardest decisions i ve ever had to make  and asking my friends to support me in keeping it   her decision   that i m worth loving  just the way i am    where do you get your self-worth from  some people seem to be born with a tremendous ability to hold themselves in high esteem  these people aren t the egoists  who are secretly desperate for external affirmation  or the narcissists who don t actually have a clue as to the meaning of real love   the true self-lovers are the ones who don t feel they need anyone else to be  complete   that they are  and will be  ok  in the absence of anyone else  other people feel pretty happy with who they are  but recognise the extra potential in those who might emphasis that happiness  pairings of these people usually yield highly rewarding relationships   however  there are many of us in the world who feel as though we re not really worth anything at all - people who feel unhappy in their own company  they are the self-loathers  not self-lovers    i used to hate myself   my friend explains   now  after years of work and self-reflection  i truly feel happy with who i am  i finally feel like i love myself  i want to declare that i will love  honour and cherish myself in front of the people i care for  and i want to ask them to support me in return    i think it s quite a beautiful idea  i ve offered to help plan a ceremony  research for which revealed that my friend is far from alone  same-self marriage  it seems  is a thing  in an article in first things  american journalist timothy george chronicles the rise of the emerging trend  from a woman called linda baker in 1993  to author of a dress  a ring  promises to self sara sharpe  to nadine schweigert  who promised to  enjoy inhabiting my own life and to relish a lifelong love affair with my beautiful self  in front of 40 close friends in 2011  but american gals aren t the only solo-brides  dutch woman jennifer hoes married herself in 2003  and had a mini-documentary made about the experience  englishwoman grace gelder also married herself last year   of course  if the above accounts prove self-marriage is a done thing  it also begs the question  it is just a lady thing  where are the solo-grooms  would a man consider marrying himself  and if we are going to see more self-marriages  is that something we should be celebrating   katherine feeney is a journalist with the nine network australia new scrabble word list age-old game embraces text-speak

of a new modern word list which is set to be heavy on the text speak   twerk  wuz  thx and other debasements of the english language are part of the about 6500 new words in the 2015 update to the

triple-word score   wuz  better than the 10-letter retirement  photo  peter braig  despite the average age of many of victoria s scrabble clubs being post-65  according to one scrabble insider  the players are fully planning to embrace the new wordlist – with strategems already being hatched on boards across the state    a word like wuz   whistles rob york   marvellous     easy to remember because it s only three letters  and it s three of the most-difficult-to-get-rid-of tiles    scrabblers will have to scheme a little longer though  a word list does not merely arrive from on high – first  it must be thoroughly checked over and accredited and accepted by the national body  the aspa  or australian scrabble players association   once that s completed  hopefully soon  the word list will come into force and people like mr york will be able to make full use of point-scorers like obvs  obviously   lolz  laughing out loud   shizzle  sure  or an expletive  and ridic  ridiculous

all 39 of them  when you’ve got this many cousins  there’s always someone to fight  a shoulder to cry on and something to celebrate  emer o’toole  ‘there are two sides at any wedding  our side and their side  and do you know which side is always bigger  better and way more craic ’  my grandmothers were two very different women  granny o’toole was an elegant  witty doctor’s wife  who lived in an ivy-trellised  mid-19th century galway townhouse  she wore fur stoles and bright lipstick  i have a mental snapshot of her kneeling at flowerbeds in her well-tended garden  wearing chic leather gloves and a wide-brimmed straw hat nicked straight off audrey hepburn  a cigarette hanging  gravity-defying  on her lip  smiling up at us in welcome as we walk through the wrought-iron gate  carelessly patting the earth  as if beautiful things just flowed from her fingers   granny fahy was a tireless  warm-hearted cleaning lady  school-dinner lady  and whatever else kind of lady would pay the bills while avoiding mortal sins  she lived on a council estate in corby  england  to where she had emigrated so her husband could work in the steel mills  the steel mills closed and  suffice to say  there wasn’t a lot of time for gardening  she dressed like a nun  she swore like a sailor  and she was hilarious  i like to remember granny fahy taking her teeth out and dancing around the sitting room in her dressing gown and slippers  a parody of a jig  gummily singing “diddle diddle eye die die ” to screams of laughter from her grandchildren   in some ways  however  these two irish women were alike  they were both mothers of nine  and they shared a controversial conviction  namely  that had better contraceptive options existed  their families might have been more modest  as granny o’toole told my cousins and me  ice tinkling in her g t as she charmed the drawing room  “if they’d had the pill 50 years ago  there’d certainly be a few less o’tooles ” or  as granny fahy regularly put it  “if there’d been them things in my day  half ye shites wouldn’t a been born ”  now  i am not wishing the trials of nine babies on any woman  but  things being as they are  i’m grateful that my grannies weren’t on the auld smarties  because  as irish families shrink from oppression-size to fun-size  there’s one thing that deserves eulogy  cousins  loads of brilliant cousins  unlike most of you cousin-poor unfortunates  i’ve had the good grace of an inbuilt personal mafia from birth  a web of stalwart genetic allies who can be dicks to each other  but will cement-shoe anyone else who insulta da family   i have 39 first cousins  conor  sinéad  fiona  tadhgh  coile  rosie  bella  niall  saoirse  róisín  darragh  brendan  brian  felim  laoise  seán  sarah  paddy  eoin  james  gretta  rory  dáithí  aoife  paula  jim  john  tina  anthony  jonathan  rachel  catherine  emily  megan  declan  liam  paul  julie and rebecca  and that’s before counting my second cousins and cousins-once-removed  it’s before counting my cousins-by-marriage or my cousins-in-law  you know  my cousins’ cousins    cousins on the beach  connemara  circa 1989   family occasions mean i’m surrounded by many of my best and oldest friends  people with whom i laugh until i suspect that someone spiked the brownies  not an impossibility   and  while i’m happy that irish women of mum’s generation were not baby factories by mandate  it’s a little sad that my future children will be among the ranks of the cousin-deprived  probably regardless of the number of times i surreptitiously break into my brothers’ bedrooms and poke holes in their condoms   in tribute  then  to my grannies’ culturally coerced fertility  i’d like to take some time to celebrate the boons of mass cousindom  here are 10 advantages of being a happy member of that dwindling institution – the humongous irish family   early political training  you’re one of a herd of small  genetically similar humans  all braying and mewling about their individual needs and desires  crying erupts approximately every 15 seconds and thus ceases to be an effective method of attracting adult concern  what can you do to ensure that your lollipop my little pony favourite stick is not stolen by your current cousin nemesis  you quickly learn the importance of assertiveness and allies  incidentally  my childhood cousin nemesis was jonathan  evidenced by the number of old photographs in which we are giving each other stink eye  apparently  we got into violent altercations every time adults left us alone for five minutes – both reasonably assertive  clearly  once  my five-year-old brother ronan  sick of us fighting  picked up three-year-old jonathan and locked him outside our front door  where he sat very distressed until the adults found him  i learned for the first time that brothers are useful  i like to think ronan’s intervention was due to my early skills at forming  political alliances  but it was probably because it was his house and  if anyone was going to fight with his sister  it was going to be him   cousin casting calls  given the number of potential artistic collaborators and or minions around at all times  cousinland is a hotbed for creativity  cousin sarah has been dressing us up  bossing us about  and making us sing since ever she was old enough to say “daaahling”  that’s why she’s a theatre director now  and seánie and i are in a band called cousins  capitalising on the obvious gap in the market for cousin-themed musical projects  expect to find our first single if you wanna be my cousin on itunes just as soon as we’re picked up by a cool  independent record label  sing it now  “oh  if you wanna be my cousin  you godda get with my other cousins …”  emer o’toole  left  with her cousin nemesis jonathan  right  in southampton circa 1989   wedding domination  there are two sides at any wedding  our side and their side  do you know which side is always bigger  better  and way more craic  that’s right   cousin education  there comes a time in every cousin’s life when older cousins know important stuff that you don’t know  older cousins are  therefore  a rich source of age-sensitive  censored information  and essential to maintaining your cool-cred in the playground  for example  aged seven  i borrowed 10-year-old sinéad’s copy of sweet valley twins  42 jessica’s secret  in it  elizabeth gets her period but jessica doesn’t  but what is a period  elizabeth just woke up one morning and it was there  but where had it come from  was it some kind of exciting toy  why was mrs wakefield cooking a celebratory meal  and  most baffling of all  why was jessica pretending to have one too – couldn’t she just borrow elizabeth’s  frankly  the book made very little sense  and sinéad refused to divulge her obvious knowledge about its central theme  so i ruined my mum’s weekend by asking her instead  and had a lot of material for discussion back at school   a cousin for all seasons  due to generational  gender and individual variations  cousins come in all sizes and shapes and are thus useful for different purposes  something up too high  get a tall cousin to reach it  locked yourself out of the house again or want to commit a breaking-and- entering felony  simply slide a small cousin through a bathroom window  need to play limbo  but lacking a pole  position a sufficiently long  light cousin between two cousins with good core strength  and bend from the knees   who needs a limbo pole when you can use a cousin instead    cousin shoulders  cousin shoulders are a particularly useful cousin body part  if you are upset  there are plenty of them to cry on  if you have a dispute to settle with another cousin  a traditional and effective way of doing so is to put a small cousin on your shoulders  invite your opponent to do the same  and engage in battle until one or other of the small cousins has toppled over  you might think this is an irresponsible conflict-resolution strategy  but in many years of organised cousin shoulder battling there have been zero injuries  and  frankly  it seems a good deal healthier than the passive aggression so often displayed by those with a lesser supply of lightweight relatives   cousin celebrations  gretta played a blinder in her leaving cert  paul had twins  with some help   catherine got married  seánie got a master’s degree  róisín found her dream job  sarah’s play got a glowing write up in the national papers  so many cousin birthdays  so many cousins to celebrate  i’m never sober   when i do occasionally muddle through the cloud of prosecco to see my cousins out there travelling places and learning things and making art and helping people and being parents and just turning  year by year  into ever more cool and interesting people  it makes my heart smile   cousin consultancy services  with 39 first cousins and many other cousinly figures  you have free expertise in almost everything  are your teeth aching  call saoirse  she’s a dentist  want to turn the cousin shoulder-battle film on your phone into a gif  thus immortalising your victory  call ciarán  he’s a film technician  want to know the name of that pokémon that looks like a giraffe and makes a noise like a windshield wiper  call laoise  she’s an anime obsessive  is your kitchen on fire  call jonathan  he’s a fireman   the cousins celebrate a family birthday in dublin in 2012   unconditional cousining  you don’t have to be in a good mood around your cousins  you don’t have to be polite or nice  or even borderline socially functional  they all know that you once picked snot out of auntie bernie’s nose when she was sleeping on the couch and tried to put it back in again when she woke up  so  really  who are you trying to impress  if you want  you can be crap around your cousins  and it’s fine  it takes a lot of the pressure out of social situations   for example  once when i was sad i turned up to my cousin sadhbh’s dinner party  drank too much  locked myself in the bathroom to cry  and was eventually coaxed out of the bathroom and put in a corner with tissues while sadhbh turned the dinner party into a misery rave where everyone danced around – at my musical request – to elliott smith  crying corner cousin  not  a problem  sometimes cousins need cry-time  just accommodate her depressing musical tastes and keep dancing   cousining is unconditional  i like it when my cousins are around  i don’t care if they are heartbroken or hungover  or don’t feel like playing cousin limbo  i would never cousin-divorce any of my cousins   free cousin refills  are your cousins getting old and a bit boring  are they a lot harder to drag out for late-night pints and dancing  don’t worry  soon they’ll start producing new  more exciting cousins  and if you have babies  then the new cousins will be their second cousins  meaning that maybe the next generation won’t be so cousin deprived after all  meaning that maybe the legacy of granny o’toole  granny fahy and the many thousands of other irish women like them – who provided not just boatloads of babies  but also  somehow  the oceans of love that kept them together – will reach far into the future  keeping us close  keeping us kin i’ve had to learn how to drink tea at arm’s length from my own mouth  every time i think i’ve figured out how to do something  my son changes and i have to start all over again  drinking tea will never be the same again   i cut my son’s fingernails last week  you wouldn’t believe what a beautiful job i did on them  with an audacity that bordered on outright arrogance  i ditched the stubby little baby scissors i’d previously been using  in favour of actual adult  metal  razor-sharp  dangerous monstrosities that looked exactly like they had been designed to take someone’s eye out  and  despite him thrashing around like a sack of eels  i still managed to give him the most perfect manicure imaginable  future historians will look back and see it as the definitive manicure of our times   three days later  the nails grew out and i had to cut them all over again  my masterpiece  ruined   this lack of permanence is really starting to get to me  it has always been like this  the first time i changed his nappy  overseen by a temperamental midwife in a boiling  windowless maternity unit while my wife lapsed in and out of an exhausted drug haze  i did a similarly brilliant job  everything was tucked in and symmetrical  and wiped so fastidiously that you could have eaten your breakfast off it   the pride i felt at doing something so well was astonishing  and then  almost immediately  he crapped himself  another masterpiece  another pile of dust   now  obviously  i’ve realised that a bit of sloppiness is ok sometimes  i halfheartedly dab his bum with a dried-out wetwipe  blob on some sudocrem if i remember  then throw the new nappy on back to front  or skewed  or with both legs sticking through one hole  or stapled together  or whatever  it doesn’t matter  he’s only going to poo in it  after all   everything is in flux  all the time  early on  i could get him to sleep by hooking my hands under his armpits  resting his cheeks on my thumbs and gently bouncing him up and down on my lap  then he got too big for that  so i took to rocking him in my arms  now that’s stopped working as well  so my current method mainly involves walking around with him for an hour while i swear under my breath   the unofficial motto of my life has always been learn the ropes quickly and then coast  that’s what it was like at school  and university  and every job and relationship i’ve ever had  get in  figure out the rules and then slack off   but a baby won’t let you do that  with a baby  everything is new all the time  you learn things – how to hold them  how to dress them  how to make them sleep – and then  just when you’ve got them down  they grow up a little bit and you’re back at square one  right now  for example  my son has just become alarmingly proficient at grabbing  so today’s lesson has involved learning how to drink a cup of tea at arm’s length from my own mouth  i’ve never had to do that before   and we’re still right at the very beginning of this journey  we’re still at the part where we’re figuring out the best way to clean a child’s bottom  we haven’t had to recalibrate and learn how do deal with a kid who moves around  or talks back  or needs homework help  or wants to stay out all night  or borrow a car  or has to move back in because  by that point  a deposit for a flat will cost several times more than anyone could possibly earn during the entire course of their lives   this is all yet to come  the rest of my life is a going to be a giant learning curve  so much for coasting martin says he’s falling in love with me – and we haven’t even met  stella grey likes the look of his mischievous smile and their online flirtation heats up  martin went on a weekend climbing trip so we had to wait to meet   the next morning  just after 6 30am  martin messaged again  “really early  in a rush  teaching summer school and going for a run first  but just wanted to say  what a delight to meet you last night  very much looking forward to talking more  see you at the usual place at around 8pm  if you’re free that is  if you’re not out on a date with some young hunk ”  “date  what’s that ” i asked him  “hereabouts  it’s a middle-eastern fruit eaten at christmas  i’ll see you around 8pm at the usual virtual corner  wait  this does sound like a date ”  “it is  it is ” he wrote  “i’m bagsying you this evening  accept no other offers ” i looked at his page again  it was a deft summing-up of a person  of martin’s mental landscape  it made me want to tear up my own profile and begin afresh  i really liked the look of him  too  in his pictures  age 44  sturdy  tall  with a receding hairline  he was a man unafraid to rock a checked shirt and brown cords  endearingly unhip  his smile mischievous  barely half an hour after getting going with the day  i had to stop and look at his profile again  my eye ran down the questionnaire part and saw something new  in answer to the question  “do you want children ” he had put “undecided”  i hadn’t taken that in before  i messaged him  “just noticed you are undecided about children  i’m past that point  if children are a maybe  we’d better say cheerio  i think ”  his reply said  “at work but just had to say  not an issue  i promise you  i tend to the no more than the maybe ” at 4 30pm there was a follow-up  “the point is it’d be no if my partner wife was also a no  and yes if she was a yes  it’d be up to her  left to myself  i’d happily be a no ”  that evening we talked on screen for two hours  afterwards  there was a message at 1am  another at 6am  and two at lunchtime  the following evening  emboldened by our growing rapport  we swapped real-world identities and email addresses  and googled each other  and had the funniest on-screen chat  by now  it was clear we were hugely compatible  but this i’ve learned  email compatibility isn’t something anyone should rely on  it can  and has been  utterly decimated by a real-world meeting   it’s easy to fall for someone over email  what’s difficult is following through into life  the closer that email conversation brought us  the more risk there was that a real encounter  in a cafe after a train journey  would be the beginning of a big letdown  i might not like him  it might be mutual  he might take against my middle-aged body on sight  this has happened  it is not imaginary   in person  he might dominate the conversation  he might be pompous and given to monologuing  he might think i was  we might find we had said everything we were ever going to  in typed  unspoken words  we might have an instant  chemical hormonal realisation that it would only ever be a sibling sort of love   i could see that it would be easy to put meeting off indefinitely  as i had so disastrously with peter  so i suggested meeting at the weekend  he said he was going climbing with friends  but  yes  soon  next week  a week is a long time in a virtual romance  emailing took us into our childhoods  our student days  our marriages and our sad stories  he had only been married a couple of years when it had broken down  they were separated but not divorced  it turned out  “i’m afraid i initiated it ” he wrote  “we wanted different things ” oh  you’re not divorced yet  i asked him  are you sure you’re ready for this  for meeting someone new  i couldn’t be more ready  he said   he went on his weekend climbing trip and was silent  as he had warned me he would be  and i was twitchy and stayed quiet  it is important to know when to be quiet  i heard from him at 7am on monday  there was a text at lunch  and then in the evening he wrote about his weekend  and i told him about mine   “i feel like i’m falling in love with you ” he replied  “couldn’t stop thinking about you  at the cottage  couldn’t stop myself rereading your letters  never experienced anything like this  caught up  caught up in it  can’t wait to meet you  this weekend  i can come to you  or you to me  don’t mind  can barely even wait until then ”  stella grey is a pseudonym‘i was cross that my child had to beg the prime minister for a drug’  sue barnley’s son has a rare fatal disease  her family is having an increasingly bitter fight to get funding for his treatment  sue and tom barnley with their sons harry  left  and jack   in the photograph that has pride of place in the living room of sue barnley’s home  her son harry is standing  all blond curls and cheeky grin  dressed as woody from toy story  his brother jack  two years older  is beside him  channelling buzz lightyear  for sue  45  the four-year-old picture belongs to that innocent time before harry  now nearly seven  was diagnosed with duchenne muscular dystrophy  a rare muscle-wasting disease that mostly affects boys  now she and her husband  tom  39  live with the knowledge that harry will be in a wheelchair before he is 12 and will probably die in his 20s   “when we finally got the diagnosis in july 2013  it was hideous ” says sue  a former sales manager from farnham  surrey  “we were in grief for the life harry would not have and the hard path he would take  the doctors told us  ‘duchenne is 100  fatal so you need to go away and enjoy your little boy and give him a good life ’ we were told not to pin any hopes on research ”  just as they had refused to listen to experts who insisted for more than two years that harry was a “healthy boy” despite his odd gait and poor stamina  the barnleys haven’t heeded medical advice on research either  in less than two years  they and their family and friends have skydived  marathoned  tray-baked and dinner-danced their way to £130 000 for duchenne research through their help4harry campaign  they are muscular dystrophy uk’s top family fundraisers   sue and tom are in the vanguard of the increasingly bitter battle to persuade nhs england to fund translarna  the first drug to target the genetic cause of md  translarna is only suitable for a minority of “duchenne boys”  whose disease is caused by what is known as a “nonsense mutation”  harry barnley is one of only 50 of the 2 500 people in the uk with duchenne suitable for a drug treatment that might give him three more years on his feet   patients can be prescribed the drug  developed by an american pharmaceutical company  ptc therapeutics  only if they are still mobile  and although harry is still walking  sue knows that the rate of his decline is unpredictable  imagine how the barnleys felt last month when nhs england effectively deferred a decision on funding the new drug – it costs around £180 000 per child per year – until next year  approved by the european medicines agency last summer under a conditional licence that allows patients early access to medicines for life-threatening diseases  translarna is already being prescribed in france  germany and spain   sue says she knows another british candidate for translarna  slightly older than harry  who could still climb stairs a few months ago but now can’t  some boys who are suitable for the drug will be using wheelchairs before the deferred decision is made   “it is so frustrating ” says sue  “for the first time there is an effective drug and yet we have to watch our sons deteriorate while they argue over funding  nhs england put the families through the hell of waiting  those last two days were terrible – and then not to get a decision …” she trails off   the barnley family have become top fundraisers for muscular dystrophy uk   nic bungay  campaigns director for md uk  says translarna has been caught up in a bureaucratic mess following the reorganisation of health services  the body that used to decide on funding for expensive new medicines for rare conditions – known as “orphan drugs” – disappeared in the restructuring and there has since been confusion over procedures   charities  campaign groups and sympathetic mps have been pushing for interim funding for translarna and also for new drug treatments for the rare conditions morquio disease and tuberous sclerosis  a few days after the translarna decision was deferred  the commons speaker  john bercow  and the lib dem mp greg mulholland were involved in a clash in the commons when mulholland tried to highlight the agony of the waiting families  bercow judged him to be taking too long to ask a question and mulholland walked out of the chamber  duchenne families felt their plight was lost in the row and were furious at bercow  “it just added to the whole fiasco ” says sue bitterly   campaigners are now pushing for the deferred decision on translarna to be made before the end of this year  sue thinks nhs england was deaf to that clock that is always ticking for duchenne families when it decided to refer the decision on translarna to the national institute for health and care excellence  nice    harry is becoming less mobile  he did not want to take part in his school sports day a few weeks ago  “he said  ‘i’ll just come last because of these’ and pointed to his legs ” says sue  his legs are increasingly painful and he wears night splints   sue and tom are reluctant activists because fighting costs them precious time with harry and jack and has forced their children into too much contact with the “world of duchenne” – a world with which  they  as adults  still struggle  “i could not have coped with a duchenne conference in the first year ” says sue  “there are a lot of older boys in wheelchairs and some can’t feed themselves ”  earlier this year  harry was one of a handful of duchenne boys who delivered letters to david cameron explaining what translarna could mean for them  “afterwards  harry asked if he would one day be in a chair like the other boys and  actually  he was a bit excited about it ” says sue sadly   jack is ahead of his brother on the learning curve but neither boy yet knows the disease is fatal   “weeks after the visit to downing street  i was doing a jigsaw with the boys ” says sue  “harry suddenly said that jack had told him he wouldn’t be able to get out of his wheelchair once he was in it  harry said  ‘that’s not right is it – my legs will still work ’”  sue told harry as gently as she could that he would be able to get out of the wheelchair at first  but eventually wouldn’t be able to use his legs  “you can’t not tell them the truth ” she says simply  the information seemed to hit home  but a week later harry said that when he grows up he wants to be a fireman   sue spreads the blame for harry’s predicament widely – the current confusion around “orphan” drug funding  “odd” nhs priorities  poor funding of the health service  and drug companies making too much profit  she also argues that the government is too paternalistic and that families with children suffering from fatal rare conditions ought to be allowed to take risks with new drugs   “when harry wrote his letter to david cameron  we got 8 000 views on our website ” says sue  “but  in the end  i was just cross that my six-year-old had to write to the prime minister  begging for a drug ”  muscular dystrophy uk’s helpline number is 0800 652 6352  freephone  or

needed a side dish  without the dynamic tension that a salad or slaw brings to the plate  quiche often feels one-dimensional – too narrow in its rich  creamy flavours  specifically  quiche needs a side that offers both cool contrast and crunch  a simple green salad or some sad bagged leaves will not cut it – of course  nor will a jacket potato  instead  think raw vegetable salads  celery  fennel  kohlrabi  radish  cabbage  etc  and slaws that minimise the mayo  you do not want a great dollop of sweet  gloopy coleslaw on there  in which the veg has been shredded into a cotton wool consistency  if you do require a little additional creaminess  greek salad is not a bad compromise   when  too insubstantial in its purest form to constitute tea  quiche is a lunch dish  except on those rare summer days when it is pushing 30c and food is  by necessity  merely a light  fleeting distraction   where  quiche is often considered picnic food  which is ridiculous for two reasons  a  eating outside is abhorrent  particularly in a park or a field  and b  how do you intend to keep that quiche warm between your oven and your picnic  quiche needs to be eaten if not immediately as it comes out of the oven  then soon after  and at a table with a knife and fork  not with one hand on an insect-strewn blanket  wreathed in exhaust fumes as you’re squinting into the sun  if you really must have some fresh air with your quiche  open the kitchen door  maximum width  two inches    drink  white wine  sparkling mineral water or other carbonated soft drinks  for the tongue-scrubbing effects of the bubbles   or strong tea  which is surprisingly good at sluicing away the dominant fats from the quiche and the pointed flavours of any accompanying salad   so  quiche – how do you eat yours how to be a sexier woman by clicking on this article  and other top tips   parody site reductress has a tough task out-spoofing reality – its editors talk women-bashing  how no lipstick will change your life and building a reputation as the onion for feminism  reductress  extraordinary that a site like it didn’t exist before  are you looking for fun spring patterns to hide your dead eyes  what about five blushers that will make your man blush  in the week since glamour magazine went viral for posting a blog titled 13 little things that can make a man fall hard for you  you might think the founders of reductress  a feminist parody site  would have their work cut out trying to out-spoof reality   created by improv and sketch writers sarah pappalardo  30  and beth newell  29  in 2013  initially supported by a kickstarter fund  reductress launched with around 50 headlines  early stories included b’oréal launches line of anti-bullying makeup for young girls and creator of ‘rape in america’ documentary talks about hair care  the pair now run the site as a full-time operation from an office in soho  new york  alongside two colleagues and an intern  reaching around 330 000 readers a month  although they peaked at 2m last november    reductress began life as a conversation between two friends about the repetitive cliches in women’s media  like all good parody sites  the line is fine between joke and reality  and this is their aim  taking and mocking the the clickbait formula of many women’s websites  which tap into our insecurities while creating emotional promises about the way we look or conduct relationships  “we don’t like to point the finger at any one publication in particular ” insists newell  “there is a good rule in comedy  punching up not punching down  it’s more media in general ”  it has become commonplace for media to condescend women with headlines subtly disguised as styling tips or dating advice and  at its most depressing  reductress exposes the way we levy criticism at ourselves for not being thin  fun or immensely dateable  and that we seek out the answers to our “failings” online  the guilty publications are fairly obvious – refinery29  elle  marie claire  racked and so on – even jezebel  gawker’s feminist blog  has come under fire  around the time the site offered  10 000 for un-photoshopped images of lena dunham’s cover shoot for vogue  reductress ran the headline  jezebel offers  10 000 for article ideas that aren’t about the evils of photoshop  as pappalardo explains  “jezebel have done some great stuff in the past  they have done some ridiculous stuff too ”  everything a female audience needs to know     the reductress   formatted in the vein of the onion  the hugely popular satirical news site  reductress uses stock images alongside its farcical headlines  trending on monday are  we call it a book group but all we do is drink wine and worship the devil  i know what’s best for the health of my family and it’s magical thinking and – office favourite – 8 sex positions that will blow his mind and destroy his penis  given the high quota of patronising content geared toward women  it’s extraordinary to think a site like this didn’t already exist   for online media  traffic is everything  which is why it’s become commonplace for traditional women’s interest sites to rely on particular formulas for eyeball-grabbbing headlines  so  rather than recommending five shades of lipstick  they will suggest that buying these lipsticks will affect – nay improve – your life  “the challenge is  when you’re trying to reach a threshold of traffic  you are forced to go for clickbait tactics  returning to the same tropes ” says pappalardo  “these sites are falling victim to the same things even if they are good at heart ” newell adds  “we also get a sense that they have talented writers that are being swayed by editors ”  and you can’t escape the fact that while reductress is mocking the media’s reliance on traffic  it is benefitting from the very culture it criticises  “but if there was another way  we’d do that too” reasons newell “there is nothing inherently wrong with talking about clothing and fashion ” she says  “and we get it – the bigger the publication  the more you need smart ‘dumb content’ ” adds pappalardo  “but ” continues newell  “it’s more the tone that implies the reader can improve their life through a lipstick ”  a cursory surf online suggests she’s right  in a few minutes  i’ve found several articles which suggest my commute will indeed be improved with a right cleansing routine  then there are all the headlines which start with “how” – a teaser which  explains pappalardo  suggests you are reading the story because you “lack something”   the majority of reductress’s headlines are cutting  but the comedy is sometimes subtle enough to dupe readers  “we ran a headline which read  we’re piercing my baby’s tongue and here’s why and people were like  ‘what a horrible mother’ ” laughs pappalardo  “others thought we were being smart by saying it’s a metaphor for circumcision  i guess it’s a case of people attaching their belief system to what you’re writing and running with it  mostly the reaction has been very positive  though ”  unexpectedly  reductress also goes after contemporary feminism and the way we talk about it  a sample headline reads  there’s no need for feminism because women are equal now  says jenna the ignorant talking otter  but it’s worth remembering that this is not about women-bashing  rather “the idea that women are reacting to themselves in relation to a man’s world ” says pappalardo  “one of our aims is to show that different kinds of feminists can co-exist ” continues newell  “our feeling is that women can attack women on substance of argument and not appearance ” but  she adds  “we are laughing at ourselves  too  and trying to promote more of a civil dialogue  like the headline burn 500 calories with these feminist debates – we are laughing at the fact that women are having these discussions – even if we are too ”how to eat quiche  this month  how to eat is cutting itself a slice of quiche  defying gender stereotypes and settling the many culinary disputes that surround the savoury egg tart  does blue cheese work in a quiche  can you really eat it with a jacket potato  and on what planet is the picnic quiche a desirable thing   how to eat’s attempt to define the ideal quiche experience is a rational new dawn for the savoury  custard-filled open pie    quiche is  arguably  the world’s most politically loaded food  to the right  and particularly when it is made with wholemeal flour   quiche defines left-wing joylessness  it smacks of self-denial  sandals  1970s communal living  to unreconstructed sexists  meanwhile – men so insecure that gender norms dictate what they eat – quiche is a byword for the new man’s namby-pamby  nappy-changing alienation from his true masculinity  but today  how to eat intends to draw a line under such idiocy  consider this attempt to define the ideal quiche experience as a rational new dawn for the savoury  custard-filled open pie  the question is not  do real men eat quiche  but rather  what kind of society accepts that question’s patriarchal premise  in 2015  a conversation about the identity politics of quiche is as relevant as cooking tips for tyrannosaurus rex steaks  so  to the btl barricades  remember  tart opinions and cheesy puns are welcome  but do not egg one another unnecessarily  as john lennon once pleaded  give quiche a chance   crust  there must be crust  there is no such thing as “crustless quiche”  that is frittata  that crust  moreover  must provide both a sound structure for the filling and offer a gently resistant bite – which is why thin  buttery shortcrust is preferable to filo or puff  theoretically  wholemeal should work with some richer or stronger flavours  but too often it dominates in a way that feels worthy   note  for once  the “i just make my own … it’s so simple” brigade  who like to post below this blog  have a point  processed  mass-market shop-bought quiches are invariably terrible  overly thick pastry is a particular problem   individual quiches  avoid  yes  quiche needs an edging of crust  but  fundamentally  that crust is a method of delivery  a discreet textural contrast  it should not be an assertive flavour  no one has ever come away from a quiche wailing  “that was amazing  but if only there had been more pastry ” the filling is the star  ergo  the individual quiche  a pastry cage with a sad  shrunken pool of pleasure at its centre  is a massive fail  it is bad enough getting the corner slice of a rectangular quiche and having to suffer two sides of pastry  but to entirely encircle that filling in pastry is criminal   hot or cold   quiche must be eaten at least residually warm  straight-from-the-fridge  cold quiche is a sad  drab thing  the filling set and leaden  the pastry all waxy with congealed fat  you need to loosen that quiche up a little  light some candles  give it a metaphorical massage  warm it through in the oven  when it emerges  the filling now wobbly  bulging  almost running free  the hot pastry light  crisp and snapping   it is a different meal altogether   filling  as above  a quiche filling should not be “set”  it must  and perhaps this is why you so rarely eat a truly great one  combine a certain luxurious density – you want to feel like you are eating something – with an airy  silky lightness  remember  also  that the custard is a setting or a canvas for the main ingredients  season it  add a little gruyère or parmesan  but the flavours of the embedded components  bacon  caramelised onions  salmon  etc  should be clearly and cleanly discernible  if  in biting into your quiche  it pulls apart like cheese strings  you have missed the point … and made a cheese pie   it is also crucial that all added ingredients are chopped into bite-size pieces so that they are evenly distributed throughout the quiche  you want a bit of everything in each mouthful   and also to protect the quiche’s structural integrity  whether it is strips of bacon laid idly across the surface or whole broccoli or asparagus spears hidden within the quiche  you often get into a situation where you cannot smoothly bite through either and  in pulling said ingredient from your quiche  it begins to fall apart   acceptable ingredients  as a broad rule  stronger  smoked and salty flavours work best in a quiche  smoked salmon  smoked haddock  crab  roasted cauliflower  spinach  broccoli  a little green leafiness is welcome in offsetting the richness of a quiche   sweet  smoky wood-fired peppers  bacon lardons  caramelised onions  feta  in chunks   goat’s cheese  roasted garlic  chives or dill  all other herbs are verboten   tomatoes  olives  grilled courgette   unacceptable ingredients  poached salmon  too mild in flavour  too soft in texture   blue cheese  when cooked  it ruins everything it comes into contact with   asparagus  particularly tinned  a highly peculiar vegetable   tuna with without sweetcorn  this is not a baguette   sausage and egg  do not even think about the full-english quiche   mozzarella  fibrously mushy chicken  see also  pulled pork   most cured meats  particularly serrano ham or prosciutto  which are difficult to bite through cleanly  chorizo  regularly far too bullying in its flavours   mushrooms  peas if you do one thing this week … build a boat  britain has more than 3 500km of waterways to explore  but instead of buying a canoe from the supermarket why not make your own   making a splash … the openboat project hopes to make rowing accessible all over the world    when did you last build a boat  maybe that seems an outlandish concept – something for noah  for loftsmen  for bearded woodsmen  not for you   but go back 50 years  and you will find lots of normal people built boats  the mirror dinghy was a plywood diy project conceived by the daily mirror newspaper in the 1960s  to bring sailing to the masses  boat building was a family pastime  a fun thing for a saturday  and achievable with little experience  basic equipment and materials   not only are they fun  but boats are useful  you can take advantage of britain’s 3 541km of waterways  revolutionise your commute  escape a flood   even if the floods aren’t coming  retired engineer jim flood  creator of the openboat project  has plans for you  flood has designed a rowing boat you can make yourself from a sheet of plastazote  camping mat material  and four strips of softwood  the total cost is around £100  a fibreglass model would set you back a couple of thousand   he has tested his design  checked it is water-worthy  and given away the instructions for free on his website  alongside instructions for making a wooden rowing machine  a canoe  and a kayak    how to build your own boat - part one   how to build your own boat - part two   flood’s motive runs deeper than just getting more guardian readers into boats  though  after he retired  he trained as a rowing coach and discovered that rowing has a problem  it’s an incredibly expensive sport  and it costs a fortune to ship fibreglass rowing boats out to poorer countries with no rowing boat industry of their own  when the boats get damaged it costs a fortune to replace the parts  often  damaged rowing boats in african or south american countries end up covered in patches  battered and abandoned  young sportspeople in developing countries aren’t pursuing rowing in significant numbers – but why would they when the sport is so richly funded elsewhere  they don’t stand a chance   the problem for rowing is that if poorer countries aren’t able to take part  the sport risks its place at the olympics   for an engineer with a creative spirit  a problem is an opportunity  flood already had experience as an innovator  “not an inventor  i’m not coming up with something new  i’m taking something and improving it ”  he’d had two ideas on the bbc science programme tomorrow’s world  including a rice-powered flag on a timer for filipino lobster pots   the answer to the rowing boat problem  thought flood  was to make rowing boats widely available  and the best way to do that was by allowing people to build their own  so the plastazote model was born  using cheap  waterproof materials which are widely available around the world   ahoy there     one of flood’s boats under construction  flood is eager for rowers in developing countries to adopt the new plastazote boats  so that they can become as ferociously competitive at rowing as those in european countries  and so that everyone can enjoy rowing in the olympics for decades to come   it’s also a way for people to reconnect with making things  “i wanted something that families could make together and have fun with ” says flood  “not just going to the supermarket and buying a canoe off the shelf  but getting involved   “people used to make canoes out of strips of canvas  today  with shop-bought boats  there is very little you can do  you can’t tinker with the exotic material or design  we are losing our connection with technology ”  anyone can help flood’s mission by building a boat of their own  “the aspirations of people in developing countries is to want what we’ve got ” says flood  “my additional aim is to get these boats made over here to show that british people are using these  dutch people are using them  german people are using them  then everyone will want one ”my wife has put on weight and i don’t find her attractive any more  how do i tell her how i feel without hurting her feelings   the subject of

please don’t send attachments  why does fashion hate old people  designers appear to favour ever skinnier  sexier and youthful women to model their clothes despite only a tiny percentage of women under 40 being able to afford them  but isn’t this a reflection of society’s worst fears   iris apfel at the hsn fashion week lounge at the empire hotel  new york  2014    why does fashion hate old people   name withheld  by email  you know  fashion gets a lot of grief from outsiders  its fetishisation of skinniness  wealth  aesthetics  sexiness and  yes  youth  are all routinely used as sticks with which to beat it  only last week topshop was roundly mocked for using mannequins so skinny they barely made anatomical sense  and this is all perfectly to the right and well and good  criticise away  lord knows this column does it often enough   but here’s the rather uncomfortable truth about fashion  all it actually does is take society’s own desires  own attitudes  and exaggerate them shamelessly  this is certainly not to excuse the fashion industry’s loopiness  stupidity and even occasional amorality  but it does explain why  despite the general consensus that fashion is demented  the industry is enormously successful  this also  i suspect  clarifies why people get so upset by it  if fashion items were sold on promises to make everyone  say  grow a third arm  no one would give a good god damn  instead  they would look at the adverts featuring three-armed models brandishing wildly expensive handbags  an extra arm so you can carry more £1 500 bags – genius    shrug  laugh and carry on with their day  they would not campaign against these adverts on social media and newspapers would not run long think pieces about how this three-armed fascism was corrupting the minds of our young   the reason people – women  mainly  if we’re honest here – get so especially upset by the fashion industry’s obsession with youth and skinniness is because it is echoing that dark  cruel voice that lives in the heads of so many of us  the one that encourages our own self-loathing  for all that people criticise fashion’s obsession with thinness  the fact is it is very rare to find any non-fashion magazine that doesn’t in some way validate this view  by using very slim models or running nonsense articles about “detoxing” and “clean eating”  what the fashion industry does  really  is exploit our own worst thoughts about ourselves  look  fashion is a billion–dollar industry  and you don’t make a billion dollars by being stupid  although an obvious exception to that rule comes in the form of future us president donald trump    which brings us  eventually  to its attitude towards old people and  in the fashion universe  this means anyone over the age of 40  never mind the industry’s occasional inclusion of older women in advertising campaigns – such as céline hiring joan didion  say  or joni mitchell shilling for saint laurent – because this is just about novelty  tokenism  faddishness  even  having an older woman in a fashion campaign is the new having an overweight pop star appear in your fashion show  which was a very popular schtick about five years ago  it doesn’t mean the fashion industry actually thinks older women  or bigger women  are attractive  a point underscored by the fact that all the models on the runway are still themselves notably young and thin  it just means the industry wants to give itself a little pat on the back for being so deep it can occasionally deal with an older or bigger person  freaks  without actually vomiting all over its quilted burberry jacket   sticking with just the ageism issue for the moment  this is clearly a ridiculous state of affairs  forget about the moral issue – it’s not even logical  only a very small percentage of women can afford to buy designer clothes and  of those  an even tinier percentage of them are under 40  and yet  designers still insist on having their clothes modelled by extremely young women – children  in some cases  such as 14-year-old sofia mechetner  who appeared in dior’s couture show last month  do many 14-year-olds now buy couture  is this what the kids are doing in between whatsapping and taking something the media insists on calling “hippy crack”  i’m going to go with “no” here  so quite why a 14-year-old should be held up as the couture ideal by a design house is beyond me  honestly  they may as well say couture should only be worn by mermaids   which brings me to iris apfel  the 93-year-old fashion icon and designer  who worked for more than 40 years  with her equally impressive husband carl  now 101  looking after the white house  apfel is currently celebrated in the lovely documentary  iris  directed by albert maysles  which i honestly could not recommend more strongly  if i had the space  i’d talk about the film and apfel all day  but the point is that what the film shows most strongly is not just how brilliant fashion looks on older women  and how it’s older women who generally have the best sense of style  because they know themselves so well  but how much they are patronised by the rest of the world  and not just the fashion industry  repeatedly  we see people talking to apfel as if she were a child  which is how older people generally are treated by all of us  yet the fact is that apfel on a bad day is sharper than pretty much anyone on a good day and this condescension is as ridiculous as the fashion industry treating age like a disease that  needs curing  but only criticising fashion for doing this is to be wilfully blind  the scary thing about the fashion industry is that  in a horrible way  it holds up a mirror to the faults within far too many of us   post your questions to hadley freeman  ask hadley  the guardian

pudding-shaped hat and a particularly cute hedgehog bauble made from pine cones  she says  “we won’t buy anything ” emily tells me they are visiting the department store especially for the christmas

father christmas is trying to get a head start too  before i reach him he has disappeared  but shop assistant moshiur chowdhury tells me they had santa in the shop yesterday  posing for pictures with children   i half think chowdhury might be an elf in disguise when he insists he is genuinely enjoying working in a christmas section while the august sun shines down outside   “people really like it ” he tells me  “it’s the nostalgia for the feeling of christmas  even if they don’t buy anything ”  but what about when the store starts piping in christmas muzak for months on end  “i love christmas music ” he tells me earnestly  i stare at him suspiciously  but he doesn’t seem to be joking  “michael bublé and all that  honestly i do ”star signings eight standout premier league football kits for 201516  who cares which team is going to win the premier league  it’s the style league that matters  with the new season kicking off this weekend  fashion writer lauren cochrane and sports writer barney ronay rate the most striking new kits  west brom’s rickie lambert  swansea city’s gylfi sigurdsson and arsenal’s mesut Özil   it’s the summer transfer window  time to get rid of the dead wood and brighten things up with new signings  that’s not just in your team’s dressing room but in your wardrobe  too  here is a selection of the best of the premier league’s parade of pricey new kits that you might not be too embarrassed to wear on the terraces   swansea away  kyle bartley of swansea city   the fashion view  how to make an impact on the pitch before you even kick a ball  dressing in a combination of lime green and navy blue should do it  swansea’s away kit is a very nike huarache colourway  and a contrast to home  which is white  elegant and very minimal  just as you might expect for a team dubbed the swans  this kit shows they have something else in their locker  a bit of flair  with a statement like that  garry monk’s team has the potential to move into the top six this season – in the fashion league  anyway   lc   the sport view  kermit-green shorts  plus humbug-stripe shirt  crowned with super-weird sponsors’ logo containing full coded details of the forthcoming robot apocalypse  continues the swansea tradition of experimental away kits  unfortunately this one looks like it was designed by a toddler on a haribo high   br   norwich city third  sébastien bassong of norwich city   the fashion view  for football fans  the third kit is in the hinterland of the sport – a sort of niche choice to wear in the stands  like buying apc over levi’s  in norwich’s case this season  the cult of the third kit may be quite small – their third shirt has already come up against winces of pain from the online football community  due to the unusual colour combination  stripes of green  mustard and primrose  actually it’s very middle-america in the 70s  think the brady bunch  and  therefore  as we say in fashion  totally now   lc   the sport view  kitschy nightmare  two main problems here   a  a strong resemblance to a 1970s geography textbook diagram of sedimentary rock formation   b  a strong resemblance to norwich’s other two kits  making this one not just tasteless but pointless  two-goal head start to the opposition   br   watford home  watford’s josé manuel jurado   the fashion view  watford’s return to the premier league this season has been marked by the club with a kit that visually spells out their nickname  the hornets  it’s yellow and black  just like the insect  still  the kate middleton school of literal dressing  tennis whites for wimbledon etc  is swerved a bit by having the stripes graduate as they go up the shirt  bringing a bit of a bridget riley look to proceedings  op art on the pitch at vicarage road every other weekend  the premier league in the modern era is a very cultured place   lc   the sport view  classic watford gold with venetian blind-style black stripes and competing animal motifs  who would win a fight between a moose  a puma and a hornet  nobody can say for sure  but at least we know what it might look like now   br   arsenal away  arsenal’s francis coquelin   the fashion view  there seems to be a bit of a thing with triangles on kits this season – both newcastle united and arsenal have them  arsenal’s  as befits a team in the top four  is the more luxe version  theirs comes in gold and with a smart little v at the neck  this is the second season the london team have worked with puma  and the fitted shape and ultra-stretchy fabric continue on the shirts  a hybrid of a chris froome cycling jersey and kardashian-worthy gym lycra  they’re great for football professionals but may prove less forgiving for fans  expect to see a clock end revival of the roomier jvc shirt as a result   lc   the sport view  classic arsenal blue and yellow  but with a respectful nod to casual terrace culture in the 1980s with those golfing-sweater diamonds  horrible in an interesting way   br   manchester city home  manchester city’s bacary sagna  l  and vietnam’s vo huy toan at my dinh stadium in hanoi  july 2015    the fashion view  manchester city have clearly been reading up on fashion trends and know that the polo shirt is the item of the season  their home kit isn’t strictly speaking a polo – that’s reserved for tennis – but the little collar and poppers at the neck are nice  safe and classic  without reinventing the wheel  an honourable mention here goes to an away kit that involves sleeves covered in the pattern of moon craters  to reference the fans’ penchant for singing the song blue moon  we’ll have to wait to see which one’s the hit at the etihad this season   lc   the sport view  retro number that references both the stark  white dog collar of the great early-1970s kit and the kind of business shirt worn by aggressive  middle-aged yuppies in the 1980s  lovely big expanse of blue  one for the high street   br   west brom away  rickie lambert of west brom celebrates with team mates    the fashion view  take away the humongous logo for an asian betting company  and there’s something almost old school about the west bromwich albion away kit  it’s the maroon colour  skinny black stripes and the curly letters spelling out wba on the crest  this appeals in a world where vintage football kits do a brisk business on ebay  tottenham’s holsten ones  and the manchester united sharp-era   perhaps the move is down to tony pulis  a man who is no stranger to style  his signature navy baseball cap sold out of the team shop when west brom announced he was to become manager earlier this year   lc   the sport view  a reprise of west brom’s classic deep red  recreated as a rothko-style nightmare of overpowering deep-gloom maroon  block colours always work and this should look pretty frightening as a team kit   br   chelsea away  chelsea’s eden hazard    the fashion view  sometimes a kit’s logo can overwhelm the rest of the design  see manchester united’s giant chevrolet   but  weirdly  chelsea’s deal with yokohama tyres actually adds something  the typeface recalls the excellent first collection of luella bartley and katie hillier for marc by marc jacobs and looks – in a good way – like a bobbly sunday league kit that you might find on the rails of a vintage store  the fact that it’s actually worn by millionaires who won the premier league last season makes us like it even more   lc   the sport view  unusual move having the french flag on both sleeves  but reminiscent of the old-school chelsea white also worn for the 2012 european cup-winning season  claims to have “special stitching” that makes players move faster  perhaps john terry can wear three of them   br   bournemouth away  bournemouth’s dan gosling   the fashion view  bournemouth’s arrival in the premier league comes with the kind of kit that suggests  when it comes to style at least  that they have been punching above their weight for a while  it’s the away kit  used last season as the third kit  as pictured here  that has caught the eye – with the colour graduated from midnight blue to darkest navy across the shirt  it’s sophisticated but wearable  as if cos made football kits  an official collaboration between the high-street store and the dorset club is only a matter of time  surely   lc   the sport view  blue-black fade that makes the wearer look as though he’s slowly sinking into a barrel of oil  bournemouth’s first season in the premier league and they’re not going quietly  the third kit is an arresting spam pink   br the sex myth why we re not talking about not getting laid  in a time of unprecedented sexual freedom  those going through a sexual drought are the new pariahs in our society  rachel hills spent seven years interviewing young people about their sex lives  this is what she discovered   ‘we’ve moved from a culture in which we were told that sex is bad and dangerous     to one in which we’re told that sex is pretty great  really – and if you’re not doing it  something must be wrong with you ’   australian author rachel hills has spent seven years interviewing young people about their sex lives – and the disconnect between their lived experiences and what they were expected to experience  her book the sex myth was published by penguin this week   brigid delaney  you talk about your early 20s as a confusing time for you where you felt yourself to be a “secret sexual loser” yet also an extroverted girl about town  do you want tell us a bit more about that   rachel hills  those two things didn’t coexist easily for me  there was definitely a tension between those things  i thought – or well i hoped – in my early 20s that i presented to the world as someone who was fun  interesting and physically attractive enough  but also just an attractive person to be around  likeable  we live in a society where if you are a young woman or a young man who is all of those things then it’s assumed that you will be sexually active because that’s part of the package  but on the other hand i wasn’t sexually active and thought that if people knew that about me they would be shocked and would see me differently  and if they knew that my sex life didn’t fit that part of the package then everything else would count for nothing   bd  you write for teen and women’s magazines  what role do these magazines play in what you term the “sex myth”   rh  they were definitely very informative  i learned a lot of what i know about sex before actually having it  from women’s magazines   from the teen magazines  what i learned was that sex was really important and really special and that you shouldn’t do it unless you are in a serious relationship  which having been defined as going out for at least six months and saying “i love you”  the message was that sex is scary and it’s something guys will try and get out of you  you have to be constantly vigilant to make sure that you only have sex when you want to have it   when i graduated to women’s magazines i learned that everyone was having sex and you have to be good at it because you don’t want to embarrass yourself when it became time for you to do it  i recall more subtle things i would see in those magazines as well – a trend story or a relationship story and the people they would chose to feature who were a little older than me and sex was very much a central part of their lives  i remembered thinking that it didn’t reflect my life  but it must reflect some people’s lives out there   bd  we’ve got magazines like rookie now  which have a different tone and are less prescriptive about sex  there’s more choice for young women and there seems to be a pushback at the messages we get from the glossies about being very sex-focused   rh  definitely  teen and women’s magazines are changing  particularly online  particularly in the us  cosmopolitan has poured a lot of money into online and there is so much content that varies widely – but a lot of it is a good  critical approach to sex  part of the reason mags like cosmo are doing this is that there is so much other critical content for young women out there such as jezebel and rookie  in order to compete for that audience  you need to get a bit smarter   i write for girlfriend magazine  in australia  and over the past few years i’ve written about trans issues  bisexuality and asexuality  i did an article recently on “five reasons you may not want to have sex yet” – but they were not the typical teen magazine reasons   for example you haven’t met anyone you want to have sex with yet  you haven’t got passt kissing yet so it doesn’t make sense to go straight to sex … there is definitely a change in narrative happening   bd  so let’s get to the crux of the book  you’re saying that the barriers – moral and cultural – have changed  and sex in our culture is a positive thing that brings social status  yet for many young people sex is elusive  there’s a whole heap of “secret sexual losers” out there   rh  exactly  we’ve moved from a culture in which we were told that sex is bad and dangerous and should only be had under very particular circumstances  to one in which we’re told that sex is pretty great  really – and if you’re not doing it  something must be wrong with you  the story we hear about younger adults in particular is one in which sex is constantly on tap  because why wouldn’t it be if there are no barriers any more  and if you’re vaguely attractive – right  but the reality is that many people go for long stretches of time without or between having sex  especially if they are single  that’s not to say that no one’s having sex any more  or that we’re not having good sex  most of us do  at least some of the time  but the standards by which we evaluate our sex lives – and the things that make us anxious about sex – have changed  we’re less likely to worry about being “perverted” or “slutty” and more likely to worry that our sex lives aren’t good enough   bd  the book was inspired by a friend of yours who was going through a “drought” – someone you assumed was having lots of sex  who confessed to you that it had been two years since she’d had sex   rh  among people i know personally a drought seems to be just what happens when you have been single for a while  they would rather have sex with an acquaintance who they find attractive than someone they don’t know very well that they have met through tinder  you’ll often see jokes in sitcoms where the character hasn’t had sex in three months and they say “that’s appalling  we need to get you laid immediately ” but it’s beyond a common occurrence for people who are single  it’s not like everyone is out there having droughts but people have at least one drought in their lives   bd  maybe it would be better if people talked about their droughts more rather than have social shame or stigma   rh  we are told that our desirability and likeability is tied up to our sexuality  talking about it would help  we talk about the times we did have sex rather than the times that we don’t   bd  such an interesting social shift to where being sexually active is prized and being inactive is shameful   rh  that’s not happening across the board  particularly in the us there is still tonnes of conversations around purity culture and slut-shaming that is tied to the idea that to be a good woman – which is a phrase some of my interviewees used – is to be circumspect about your sexuality  someone who basically doesn’t have sex unless they are under particular circumstances   bd  what sort of circumstances   rh  either she’s in a relationship or she’s married  and i think those ideals definitely still abound  the ideal of waiting until marriage is really only common among very religious people and it’s something they struggle with   i don’t think i aspired to be pure but that ideal did influence me  because that ideal was in the teen magazines  the good girl waits until she’s in a relationship but this ideal now coexists with a self-actualised  sexy  confident woman who loves sex  knows what she wants and fearlessly goes after it   the young women i spoke to wanted to be the second type of girl  partly because it is more fun to be that girl but it also presents a set of rules and regulations of what you have to be doing  that way of being isn’t going to be right for everyone and it’s not going to be available for everyone every time  the key rule if you are liberated is that it automatically means you’ll be having lots of sex  but it’s possible to live up to that ideal  to be a fun liberated person and go for months or years without having sex because a good opportunity didn’t come up   when i wasn’t having sex  it wasn’t necessarily my choice  if i had my choice at the time i would have been sexually active but it was preferable to other choices – to have sex with people i wasn’t attracted to  didn’t trust or wasn’t interested in  my choice in that non-ideal situation of limited options was not to be having sex   rachel hills in new york    bd  you talk about lack of options or limited options  but dating app tinder has become a major disrupter  if you don’t want to go out every night of the week and trawl bars – you can do it at home  it’s an easy way of hooking up because you suddenly have a lot more options   rh  i see how in theory tinder is radical  i did most of my interviews in 2012 and there was a whole bunch of media conversations about how the internet is changing sex  but tinder wasn’t a thing then  but one of the things that was interesting to me was that the internet didn’t really figure at all in my interviews  i mean they brought it up when they were talking about accessing information  but  people weren’t really using the internet to hook up and date  i was talking to quite young people  many of whom were in communities like college or school  where there was a pool of people to date  now people are definitely using tinder  one of the things that is potentially appealing about tinder  particularly in australia and british culture  is it cuts through the lack of communication about whether or not you are attracted to someone  we prefer to do things in coded ways  so you can sense that someone is attracted to you but until you actually hook up you’re often not sure  what i like about tinder is it takes the confusion out it   bd  it’s almost an americanisation of hooking up whereas the aussie and british way is to get really drunk and fall on someone and kiss them   rh  the panic about the hook-up culture in the us was connected with things being done in a more british or australian way   does tinder create more options  it does in theory  but sometimes people do want more sex and that’s fine but what if people want sex that’s attached to a person they like  someone that they actually like or connect with  or with whom they can hang out with or go to dinner with occasionally  that’s the kind of sex i was looking for and that’s harder to find than the totally casual kind  tinder could have got me on a bunch of dates with a guys i thought were hot but doesn’t completely solve the issue   bd  moral panic over so-called hook-up culture in the us was something that sparked the ideas in the book  want to tell us about that   rh  i started thinking about the ideas in the book in 2007 and 2008 because of the media environment at the time – a lot of discussion about hook-up culture and raunch culture  ariel levy’s book female chauvinist pigs  2005  explored raunch culture  which was about the idea that women were emulating particularly styles of dress and behaviour that were previously seen as being objectifying  and treating it as empowerment  and she didn’t think it was empowering  but her arguments got reduced and i don’t think the commentariat at the time were worried about it being anti-feminist but instead being vulgar and slutty   hook-up culture  which is different but emerged around the same time  was panic around young people having sex outside a romantic relationship   actually most hook-ups happen with people you already know  the most common person to hook up with is your ex  what people were worried about in the us was that young people were hooking up without going on dates  i thought to myself  this is how australians have done it for a very long time   american dating to me sounds very unappealing  you go out with someone you don’t know and have to make an assessment about them – ideally on the first date or in a few dates and whether or not you want to have sex with them  whereas at least in the australian model  you spend time with someone and decide whether or not to have sex with them   bd  which model works better   rh  i am biased because i like what i know  i am socialised to prefer the australian model  but i’m married now and so i don’t date any more  but i’m struggling to imagine australians asking each other out and calling it a date   bd  ian mcewan’s on chesil beach captures that moment in time before the sexual revolution – and it’s heartbreaking  all the things left unsaid  and the misunderstandings  but then you have a movie like shame – which is set in the now – and it’s all sex and it’s all porny  soulless  dystopian and grim  a middle ground would be a good place to be   rh  i don’t think what we have at the moment is freedom … but i don’t want to go back to the past  i want to go to the future where people can have lots of sex if they want to  lots of sexual partners  where they can go through a drought and not worry about being a loser  where they can be asexual and not worry about being soulless   with the world that shame depicts it’s sex as consumption – the way that consumer goods are sold to us  it’s sold by tapping into this need for validation  when i talk about consumer sex  i mean sex becomes part of the apparatus to prove yourself to be confident and desirable  it’s the dystopian part  but it’s not that way for everyone  casual sex can also be joyful  but it’s not like we live in a world without love  people fall in love every day  we just also live in a world where sex is weighted down with a huge grand significance for who we are and how we fit into the world brew do you think you are why tea needs to copy coffee in order to survive  britons aren’t drinking tea like they used to – sales are down by 22   is it time for the nation’s favourite beverage to take tips from its upmarket cousin   stirring up debate  a tea bag  yesterday    tea is out of favour  by tea  i mean standard black tea from a teabag  with or without sugar  in a mug or taken away  comforting  habitual  biscuit optional  according to research by consumer analysts mintel  sales of black tea have dropped by 22  over the past five years  in 2010 britons bought 97m kg of tea  last year only 76m kg  mintel thinks that figure will continue to decline  what’s behind britain’s cooling enthusiasm   apparently the under-35s prefer green or herbal teas  global warming’s effect on prices may also have affected sales   maybe the tea campaigners and climate change groups can get together on this one   and  the report says  people are prioritising their health and buying fewer biscuits  but of course  the biggest culprit is none of these things  the real reason for tea’s decline is coffee   unlike tea  coffee is aspirational  it is a rolex in a cardboard cup  a takeaway flat white bulletproof says you have means and a lifestyle  money to spend  time to wait  the taste to pay for something better  with its steely levers  clanking and hissing  the coffee machine hides its secrets in a puff of magic steam  but any fool can make a tea  it is the anti-coffee  a beverage so unaspirational that it is fondly known as a “builders’”  i have nothing against builders – my dad was a builder – but even builders have gone off a cup of builders’  the last lot who came to my house asked for a cafetiere   so the tea market is evolving  fancifying  natasha kelly  who last year opened tiosk on east london’s broadway market - a cafe selling only tea - calls it “the new tea”  she sells 40 kinds  each has a specific ratio of leaf to water  a timer on every pot that’s brewing  kelly calls her staff “tearistas” and warns against apologising to customers who stumble in looking for coffee  “we made a choice  don’t be sorry ” she says  at launch  she expected english breakfast to be the bestseller  but it has been outstripped by the matcha latte and chai latte  teas whose names have clearly been influenced by premium coffee  is top-end tea trying to turn into coffee   “it does reflect the coffee culture in many ways ” kelly says  “coffee has become so particular  almost like wine ” she says  “we drink tea second only to water and yet we still think it’s ok to have a teabag thrown in a cup of boiling hot water  it seemed like an obvious gap in the market ” there were precedents for how to fill that gap  her business partner was impressed by the tea-bar scene in san francisco  in 2012 starbucks acquired the us tea bar chain teavana   maybe it is right that the humble teabag has had its day  shaan mahrotri  who keeps a teapot on his desk at the rare tea company and drinks about 10 cups a day  says he “hasn’t seen a decline in black tea at all”  and his company supplies premium teas to the likes of claridges  perhaps it is not tea that britons are losing enthusiasm for  but teabags  in an age of hyperspecific passions  maybe they are just too generic  according to mintel’s emma clifford  sales of green and herbal teas are thriving  although insufficiently “to compensate for the decline of black tea”  the report urges pg tips and tetley to explore other ways to engage consumers’ interests  or  as clifford puts it  “to grow awareness that a teabag doesn’t have to be used in the standard cup of tea format”  tea can survive  but it may need to turn into something else kitchen gadgets review evenslice bread slicer – ‘not the best thing since sliced bread   do you

people  and during filming for the spine race film  damian hall and his gopro camera became oddly close  the pennine way during the spine race 2015 … it’s definitely not barbados    it’s still strange seeing yourself on screen  even in our smartphone age  in the spine race film  i don’t look nearly as heroic as i’d hoped  i teeter in the wind  i slur my words  the eyes don’t lie  apparently  and in mine you can clearly see fear and vulnerability  i thought i was some kind of warrior of the wilds  impervious to all that the weather and the race could throw at me  it turns out  i’m a bit of a wimp

oldest and toughest national trail  which wiggles  rises and falls all the way from the peak district to scotland  the spine race is known for extreme weather  sleep deprivation and hallucinations  and for myriad afflictions from trench foot to hypothermia  but i also wanted to show just how life-affirmingly joyous it can be too  the huge highs it gives you  the many memorable moments  and some of the wondrous  not a phrase that stretches to a waterlogged blenkinsopp common at 3am  admittedly  and gloriously remote scenery the race passes through   i was thrilled to fortuitously capture a scene where  as beth pascall  mark townsend and i descend from the extraordinary snow-clad canyon of high cap  semi-wild ponies galloped across our path  it’s only a few seconds of unsteady footage  but i’ve probably watched it 20 times and it sends a shiver up my spine  pun half-intended  each time   if i was trying to show what the spine is really like  there’s another moment that should have been in the film  between alston and bellingham  four days into the race  i had my lowest moment  i felt powerless for hours  i was getting lost in idiotic ways  i felt like it had been dark for days  i was so tired and paranoid that i thought a local who helped me with directions was trying to sabotage my race  painkillers weren’t masking my tendonitis and i was worried about long-term damage  i contemplated giving up  i reached for the camera to … i’m not sure what exactly  probably whinge self-pityingly about it all  maybe cry a bit  but the battery had died – thankfully  on reflection   the camera became my little friend  a little pocket pet i could talk to  i told it all sorts of things  when i felt great  when i felt not so great  i even told it jokes  i’m pretty sure i fed it shot bloks  the spine race takes you to some strange new places  and i don’t just mean alston   and there’s plenty of that strangeness – from me and from others – in the film   it’s a wonderful adventure

the chef’s chef is recreating ‘blurred memories’ of childhood at his new restaurant  taberna do mercado  to launch his monthly recipe column  he shares the secrets of portuguese cuisine  exclusive  three recipes from nuno mendes  nuno mendes  ‘i want to cook for people who would be my friends ’  the week the chiltern firehouse opened in central london  it was so full of famous people that something went wrong with the cosmic ratios  my fella and i sat between kirsten dunst and sol campbell  we were outnumbered  gordon ramsay was there  and i asked him what he thought of nuno mendes  the superstar chef  i was in search of mischief  some spurt of alpha-male jealousy  ramsay  smarter than that  said  “he’s a chef’s chef  fingertip control ”  mendes was already known on the foodie circuit for the loft project in east london  where he pioneered tasting menus and unearthed young talent  viajante followed  in bethnal green town hall  where he got his first michelin star  the firehouse got him talked about at a different order of magnitude  it is still rammed with names  a year and a half in  paparazzi wait dutifully outside  and the flashing through the night makes it look  from the enchanting garden  as if you are surrounded by police helicopters  it is a great circus of a restaurant  distilling all the excitement and horror of 21st-century london – we’ve taken our fire-service infrastructure  sacked all the firefighters  and filled it with stars and front-of-house staff more beautiful than makes any human sense  god knows what will happen if there is ever a fire  hopefully the paparazzi will be able to help   “don’t call it a circus ” mendes says  ruefully  i met him outside his new restaurant  taberna do mercado  in spitalfields market  london  it was 9 30am  and i couldn’t figure out how he’d got so many stains on himself so early in the morning – at one point  i was idly checking his beard for crumbs while we chatted  “the combination of food and scene  that didn’t exist before ” he notes  “it seemed it was always about one or the other  if you go for the food  the scene is usually not as interesting  if you go for the scene  the food is …” he tails off  “crap ” i supplied  the food in the firehouse  by contrast  was brilliant  his caesar salad an instant global hit   when i first met mendes in march  he was coy about taberna  periodically muttering  “i may have some project that i might do …” the best chefs now remind me of poets in the henrician court or painters in renaissance florence – they command huge cultural status  for good reasons  but they also rely on a patron  which in 2015 means a landlord or a proprietor  so there is always something they’re not allowed to say  which  being in possession of these great big spirits  makes them constantly want to say it  always on the edge of calling anne boleyn a slag or mourning the rapacity of the london landlord   but we had only just met  and he was quite reserved  and we started talking about his caesar salad  how you make an emulsion out of a lettuce so that it tastes like a super-lettuce  how the changing mouthfeel makes you focus  textural interruptions  such as the crunch of a crouton that means you taste the whole thing over again in a different way  why the anchovies come from the azores  there is a whole arc of history  empathy  conflict  sensory perception  chemistry and intellect heaped into this one salad  he talked about it for half an hour  “and hopefully ” he finished  “that makes it pretty tasty ”  nuno mendes at the chiltern firehouse   the food in taberna do mercado is different  it seems simple  but it’s not  it is poetic  complicated  nostalgic – he talks about creating dishes from “blurred memories”  “we  whether we like it or not  become ambassadors for our country … there are so many things being lost  little by little  there is lots of unemployment in portugal  all these artisans losing their jobs  if you don’t act quickly on these things  it will be a sterile environment to go back to ” he pauses  looking a bit embarrassed  “i’m not even that patriotic ”  when mendes first arrived in london in 2008  he started with tasting menus at bacchus  when hoxton was still young and before young people turned foodie  i slagged it off at the time  said the myriad foams looked like the spit cuckoos do for their young  i just didn’t have a clue   “it lasted two years  it was doing ok by the end  the first three or four months were fucking rough ” he said  “but if bacchus hadn’t closed  i wouldn’t have done the loft  and that’s probably the most interesting project i’ve ever done ”  mendes left portugal in his late teens to study marine biology in miami  but he was already in love with cooking  his father refused to countenance a change of course unless he came back and worked on their farm in portugal for a year  “i think he was really scared  i was his only son  even though he had step-sons  and i think he realised that if i went  i would never go back ” although he studied in the us  the learning experience he always returns to is this year on the farm  i’ve never met a chef so soppy about animals  “i used to see little piggies when they’re this small  they’re adorable  i can’t look at suckling pig on a board  and with cows  it is a bit emotional  we removed them from their mothers  it was mainly a dairy farm  and i used to go and feed and care for them  and hang out with them  they’re really cool ” he can’t eat veal  he can barely eat pig   mendes worked in many seminal restaurants – jean-georges vongerichten  el bulli – learning as much about what he didn’t want to do as what he did  “jean-georges had an open kitchen in trump tower and we did this amazing food  you looked into the dining room  and it was full of people who … this is what they ate every day  amazing food was arriving at their table  and they were looking at their phones  i don’t want to cook for people like that  i wouldn’t want to go there for dinner  i want to cook for people who would be my friends ”  he left the us after a constellation of unfortunate events – “a coyote ate my cat … i accidentally hit a cow … my dog …” he tailed off   i didn’t want to know what happened to the dog   he arrived at el bulli in 2003  two days after his 30th birthday  “what i was looking for was to see that it existed and that it was possible to do a restaurant based on ideas rather than a business plan  everywhere i’d worked  as creative as they were  was always a business  it was always a service  i wanted to see a place that said  ‘this is made to open your mind ’ and i saw that  but i also realised how late i was  most of the other guys there were in their early 20s ”  portugal is the great untold story of food  eclipsed by spain and undervalued for its global impact  goan food has a huge amount of common etymology   its curiosities are relatively unknown  its custard tarts the main calling card  there are the gentler  sweeter cured hams from chestnut-reared pigs  “how can they call iberian ham world-beating ”   croquettes of cuttlefish  alheira  king of the portuguese sausage  made from game  “taste that sourness  that’s fermentation  there’s no vinegar in there”   pink marlin  dried moray eel  a sea crop spreading from the algarve to the azores  tinned fish  langoustines  prawns  goose barnacles  crazy little creatures that you tug the skin off like a leg warmer  botollo sausage  made from the spine of a cow  which gave us the word “botulism”  at taberna do mercado  a lot of that is recreated  along with stews  mint hiding where you don’t expect it  cockle broth underneath runner bean fritters  “blurred memories from the way i ate in my childhood”  it is spectacular  but  the emphasis is not on spectacle  “i want it to be a little portal into portugal ” says mendes   five more chef’s chefs  thomasina miers on rené redzepi  chef and co-owner  noma  he has done such extraordinary things for scandinavian food  i love following the progress of his restaurant touring the world  first in japan and now in australia  i love his unquenchable love of ingredients  and i love how he has just opened up and told everyone exactly how much he earns  as with many of the world’s best chefs  he embodies this wonderful dichotomy of wanting to push food to the very limit of what you can do with it while loving absolute simplicity   raymond blanc on ollie dabbous  chef and owner  dabbous  london  ollie is young and full of ideas and creativity  seasonality is central to his cuisine  which i think is so important  he grows his own fresh herbs – it’s what all of us should be doing at home  too  he is truly innovative with his cooking  i like that he is pushing gastronomic boundaries   allegra mcevedy on april bloomfield  chef and co-owner  the spotted pig and the breslin  nyc  so many chefs these days force things  with too much going on  too many unusual ingredients just to be different  but with april  there is no tension on the plate  just a beautiful simplicity  it’s a joy to eat  and when you meet her  she’s exactly the same  down to earth  relaxed  she doesn’t care for fame  she just wants to make good food and make people happy   asma khan on cyrus rustom todiwala  chef proprietor  café spice namasté  much like vivek singh  cyrus is keeping alive the roots of authentic  traditional indian cuisine in his food  traditions that even in india are dying out  his parsee heritage is a beautiful amalgamation of indian and

houses in india   stevie parle on ruth rogers  chef and co-founder  river café  for her confidence  vision and dedication to delicious  simple food  and for the fact that  nearly 30 years after river

be as delicious as the recipes they describe  they give the bookish cook not only new dishes and ingredients  but the spark for new ideas and rich  run-to-the-kitchen inspiration  ed smith’s favourite food writers are fergus henderson  simon hopkinson  nigel slater and  more recently  niclaus balla and courtney burns’ in their new book  bar tartine    the best food writing stays with you far longer than the time it takes to read the words on a page  maybe you’re drawn to evocative prose  or a nugget of advice resonates and suddenly makes everything clear  it could be that a recipe stands out  calls to you  and you go on to create it with great success  time and time again  or it could simply be that a theme or a pairing of ingredients is new and inspiring   cookery books and recipes have probably been my primary source of food education  of course  i’d like to think that intuition plays a part in what i cook and why  ditto the experience of eating out  travel and watching others work  but i devour words  they’re so often the spark for a weekend in the kitchen  the reason i know what flavours go together and what methods work best   i tend to scan for ideas first  then dive in deeper when elements of a dish or a particular paragraph catch my eye  sometimes i’ll follow a recipe exactly  but more often than not  and i can’t be alone in this   that recipe triggers an idea and i’ll go off at a tangent  though i’ll remember and note the source   every monday  i publish a digest of the recipes in the weekend newspapers on my blog  i’ve been doing this for about 18 months now  at times  the process of reviewing and writing can be a slog  usually about 10pm on a sunday when everyone else is finishing the red wine or watching homeland or both   but each week  without fail  there’ll be a clutch of recipes that are stimulating and refreshing and that  consciously or subconsciously  i’ll emulate in some way  the recipes below have undoubtedly evolved from the works of others  though of course i think they’re delicious in their own right   tomato and fennel tart with basil tapenade dressing  a year ago  i cooked a quite wonderful rowley leigh tomato tart  it stood out  because it had a base of finely diced fennel in a thickened slick of egg and cream  i now can’t imagine making a tomato tart without that  his pastry was shortcrust  but i much prefer tomatoes on and surrounded by puff pastry – there’s just something about the flaky butteriness that suits cooked tomatoes  the tapenade-like dressing cuts through the acidity of the tomatoes and the rich base   the fennel for this recipe needs to be really finely diced  separate the layers and cut into thick pieces that sit flat to make this easy   serves 6-10  depending on hunger  1 large fennel bulb  very finely diced  2 sticks of celery  very finely diced  125g double cream  2 egg yolks  750g large red tomatoes  sea salt  375g pack ready-rolled all-butter puff pastry  extra virgin olive oil  for the dressing   50g kalamata olives  20g capers  3 anchovies  40ml olive oil  juice from ½ lemon  20 basil leaves  4 sprigs of thyme  leaves only  1 make the fennel base in advance  as it needs to cool  sweat the fennel and celery in a little butter for 10 minutes until soft and sweet  add the cream and cook for about 2 minutes – it’ll just coat the vegetables  season and cool to room temperature  stir in the egg yolks and place in the fridge until needed   2 preheat the oven to 200c 400f gas mark 6  slice the tomatoes about 5mm thick  put these on a plate  sprinkle with salt and leave for 10 minutes to remove some of the juices   3 in the meantime  roll the puff pastry out on to a floured baking sheet  use the back of a knife to score  not cut  a line 1 5-2cm in from the edge  all the way round the rectangle  spread the fennel mix over the middle of the pastry up to the line   4 arrange the tomato slices in overlapping lines across the tart  once assembled  drizzle a little olive oil over the top and place in the oven  after 20 minutes turn the heat down to 170c 335f gas mark 3-4 and cook for 20 minutes more   5 meanwhile  make the olive dressing by finely chopping the olives  capers  and anchovies  put these in a mixing bowl  add the oil from the anchovy tin  the olive oil and lemon juice  finely slice 10 basil leaves and add to the dressing with the thyme leaves  set aside   6 when the tart’s 40 minutes is up  turn the heat up again to 200c 400f gas mark 6 and cook for 5-10 minutes more until the pastry is brown and crisp  remove the tart from the oven and leave to cool a little  you want to serve it warm  not hot   7 tear the remaining basil leaves and drizzle the dressing over the tart just before serving  eat with a crisp green and bitter leaf salad   baby aubergine stew  there’s no single reference point for this stew  but it owes much to years of reading the likes of claudia roden  sam and sam clark  diana henry and yotam ottolenghi – why else would i add honey  cinnamon and cumin to what would otherwise have been a more intuitively mediterranean mix  also  i keep seeing baby aubergines in weekend recipes  and that makes me want to cook and eat them   put honey  cinnamon  cumin and sumac on the yoghurt - it really makes the dish    serves 4  500g baby aubergines  top trimmed but otherwise whole  250g sweet marconi peppers  top trimmed and quartered lengthways  2 banana shallots  quartered and separated into leaves  a bunch of fresh coriander  2 garlic cloves  minced  dash of red wine  optional   400g tinned plum tomatoes  1 tbsp honey  1 tbsp cumin seeds  toasted and pounded  1 tsp chilli flakes  a handful of fresh thyme sprigs  1 small cinnamon stick  250g cherry tomatoes  1 tbsp sherry vinegar  salt and black pepper  40g toasted almond flakes  1 fry the aubergines in a large pan over a very hot flame for 5-10 minutes  until they blacken and wrinkle  remove from the pan and do the same with the peppers   2 sweat the shallots in a large casserole for 5-10 minutes until soft and sweet  finely chop only the stems of the coriander and place in the shallot pan with the garlic  cook for 30 seconds then turn the heat up and add the aubergines and peppers   3 deglaze the pan with a glug of red wine  if you have it  add the tinned tomatoes  refill the tin with water and pour that in too  add the honey  cumin  chilli flakes  thyme and cinnamon stick  turn the heat down and cook with a lid on for 30 minutes   4 remove the lid  add the cherry tomatoes and cook for 20-30 minutes more  until the aubergines are almost collapsing  the cherry tomatoes split and yielding  and the sauce a little thickened  season with the sherry vinegar  salt and pepper to taste   5 roughly chop the coriander leaves and add half of these and half the almonds to the stew  stir  sprinkle the rest over the top of the serving dish  or people’s bowls  serve with greek yoghurt sprinkled with sumac and flatbread or couscous   ed smith

intimacy and not feel pressured to have ‘amazing sex’  as study also finds 51  of people have not had sex in past month  relationship charity relate said people can put so much pressure on themselves to have ‘amazing sex’ that they end up avoiding it altogether   fewer than half of uk adults say they are satisfied with their sex life while even more say they have not had sex in the past month  according to research by charities   relationship charity relate said people often put so much pressure on themselves to have “amazing sex” that they end up avoiding it altogether or do not notice what is actually good about their sex lives   it has carried out research  which is to be published in full in september  in collaboration with marriage care and relationships scotland   the yougov study of around 6 000 uk adults found only 45  said they were “fairly satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their sex life  while 51  said they had not had sex in the past month   relate  which provided more than 20 000 sessions of sex therapy in 2013-14  said couples often say they want to bring the spontaneity back  but sex is rarely truly spontaneous and busy people sometimes have to plan for intimacy   the charity also recommends that couples should not shy away from planning sex  or from kissing and cuddling in front of their children  parents have been told in the past avoid showing physical affection in front of their children but it is actually reassuring for children to see that their parents love one another  relate said   psychosexual therapist and relate institute lecturer cate campbell said  “it’s sad that so few people are sexually satisfied and put pressure on themselves to perform  noticing what is going well  rather than dwelling on problems  is quite difficult when we’re all bombarded with messages about how sex ‘ought’ to be   “sex definitely doesn’t have to be disappointing – there’s plenty that can turn your situation around so you can enjoy a sustained  fulfilling sex life   “what constitutes a satisfying sex life can vary wildly from one person to the next  so working out what makes you tick is a great starting point  people may feel concerned if they haven’t had sex in the past month but there are plenty of other ways to be sexy that don’t involve full intercourse ”  campbell has written the relate guide to sex and intimacy  which is published on 6 august how to make the perfect tzatziki  full-fat yoghurt is at the heart of this classic greek dip  but the additions are up for grabs  should you dice your cucumber or grate it  is punchy dill or cooling mint the perfect garnish  and how much garlic is too much   felicity cloake’s perfect tzatziki   this classic dip  pronounced zat-zee-key or chat-chee-kee  according to who you listen to  is the greek variation on a common theme around the mediterranean and middle east  or what i like to think of as “the yoghurt zone” – see also balkan tarator  turkish cacik and iranian mast-o-khiar  familiarity has bred contempt however  and poor old tzatziki has not emerged well from greece’s tourism boom  as rick stein puts it  its reputation has been “tarnished by being offered in mass-produced form in every supermarket for consuming with those frightful taco chips for every rinks party from here to wagga wagga”  personally  i rather like “taco chips”  though  after a week in zante as a teenager  i prefer my tzatziki with pringles   but he’s right  bland  watery versions  light on the cucumber and heavy on the cornflour have become the default option in many a dip quartet  fortunately  it’s ridiculously easy to make yourself at home   the yoghurt  your tzatziki stands and falls on the quality of the yoghurt you use – and it really should be greek  although  at a pinch  you could use ordinary whole milk yoghurt and strain it yourself   i did have a go using a low-fat variety  the things i do for you lot  but  unsurprisingly  it lacks the rich flavour and creaminess of the real deal  swap it in if you must  but be in no doubt – your tzatziki will suffer  bear in mind that even full-fat greek yoghurt is generally only 10  fat  and the biggest brand in this country  fage – the renamed total – is now half that   sour cream  by contrast  is at least 18    because fage have reduced the fat content of their yoghurt  and stopped using ewe’s milk  purists may want to use a more traditional brand  which can be easily found online  if you have time  i’d certainly recommend straining it  as rebecca seal suggests in her book the islands of greece  simply to make it even thicker and creamier   rebecca seal’s tzatziki    the cucumber  cucumber is not an ingredient that plays well with others  the high water content has a tendency to leach out into the dish and cause it to separate  there are two things you can do to stop it in its tracks – scoop out and discard the watery middle  as theodore kyriakou suggests  or squeeze out the water  as most other recipes do  i prefer the latter option  as it’s less wasteful  i’m also going to salt it and leave it to sit in accordance with the recipes in belinda harley’s lovely book roast lamb in the olive groves  a mediterranean cookbook and tessa kiros’s falling cloudberries  not only does this help draw out more water  but improves the flavour of the cucumber and keeps it crisp   kyriakou  kiros and stein all peel their cucumbers  the last two in alternate strips  i rarely bother to peel mine for salads  and i’m not sure why you’d bother here either  especially as the skin contains much of the fibre  kyriakou is the only one to finely dice  rather than grate  his cucumber  grating obviously releases more liquid  but it also gives the dish a smoother texture  the version from real greek food  though delicious  feels more like a cucumber salad with yoghurt   tessa kiros’s tzatziki   garlic and onions  harley notes that “there are two sorts of tzatziki” and  in paxos  an island she has been visiting for more than 20 years  “i have heard it described as ‘hot’  it’s supposed to ignite your senses  not cool them  garlic has an assertive  warming role ” to that end  her recipe for “spiro’s party tzatziki” uses a whole head of garlic for a kilo of yoghurt  while kiros uses only two cloves for 600g  though she counsels readers to “use as much garlic as you like”    marinating the garlic in olive oil as both harley and kiros suggest does help rob it of much of its aggression  allowing  as the former explains  “the flavours to infuse and the oil to ‘cook’ the garlic  taking out its bitterness and softening it so that when eating it you do not  as spiro describes it  come up against ‘rocks in the road’”  truth be told  i still find it rather overpowering  but when i come back to the dish a couple of days later during a lunchtime fridge forage  i find it has mellowed considerably – all the more reason to allow your tzatziki to sit quietly for a while after making it  as kyriakou advocates  rather than eating it immediately  as stein urges  he’s also the only person to use spring onions in his tzatziki  they go well with yoghurt and cucumber  but i don’t think they add anything – garlic should be the predominant flavour   tzatziki  a la rick stein   herbs  the biggest divergence of opinion where this simple recipe is concerned is on the subject of herbs  dill or mint  harley says  in paxos  tzatziki “is finished with fresh dill  for astringency  not mint  which tends to be cooling”  seal also comes down in favour of dill  stein suggests you can use either  while kyriakou uses dried mint instead of fresh  personally  i’m not keen on the dried stuff  which i find too strong  and my testers are divided on the fresh herbs – most express an initial preference for fresh mint  on the basis that’s what they’re used to in supermarket tzatziki  but are surprised to discover they rather like dill too  i conclude the latter gives the dish a more complex savoury flavour  but feel free to use whichever you prefer  though i’d encourage mint fans to give dill a whirl at least once    theo kyriakou style tzatziki    extras  tzatziki generally contains a little acid in the form of white wine vinegar  as used by stein and harley  or lemon juice  as deployed by seal and kiros  i slightly prefer the vinegar  which has a cleaner sharpness  but don’t find a great deal of difference between the two  everyone uses olive oil too  with harley sticking in a “water glass full” which  unless hers are thimble sized  is a fairly generous slug  seal adds a mere tablespoon  well-drained greek yoghurt should be creamy enough on its own  but brands vary  so i’d suggest starting with a couple of tablespoons  then adding more to taste if you think it lacks richness  allow to blend and mellow for a few hours before serving  preferably with pringles   felicity cloake’s perfect tzatziki   serves 6   500g whole-milk greek yoghurt  preferably ewe’s milk  4 cloves of garlic  or more or less to taste  2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil  ½ large cucumber  1 tbsp white wine vinegar or lemon juice  small bunch of dill or mint  if time allows  put the yoghurt in a sieve suspended above a bowl and leave to drain for a couple of hours  meanwhile  crush the garlic into the oil with a pinch of salt and leave to infuse   coarsely grate the cucumber and put in a colander in the sink  salt lightly  toss and leave to drain for 30 minutes   stir the garlicky oil and vinegar into the yoghurt  squeeze out the cucumber very well  then stir this in  too  allow to sit for a couple of hours  but preferably overnight   just before serving  season to taste  adding more oil or vinegar if necessary  then finely chop the dill or mint  discarding the tough stems  and stir into the tzatziki   tzatziki  a fine way to support the greek economy  or taramasalata’s poor relation  how do you like yours  and what do you serve it with – pitta  pringles  or paidakia  and will anyone claim that it is better with low-fat yoghurt i m dating two women i met online but getting serious with one  is it wrong to keep it up  swipe right is our advice column that tackles the tricky world of online dating  this week  eva delves into ethical dilemmas that arise when things get serious  got your own online dating quandaries  send ’em to eva  askevaguardian gmail com  swipe right  online dating for the real world    dear eva   i have been using tinder for about a month  and contrary to what i expected it worked right away  i quickly found two women that i have tons of things in common with and started having great conversations with both of them   i have been dating both for a couple of weeks and it’s getting kind of serious with one of them  but i still feel like i am not ready to commit   is it wrong to keep dating both  do i have to explicitly tell them that i am also seeing someone else   i doubt anybody would take that well   i feel like it happened so fast  and i want to make sure i’m not missing out on anyone else – but i also don’t want to be a jerk   hey  you   when i received your email i was walking down the street with a girlfriend and i read it out loud to her  “you have to hear this ” i said  “it’s a message from an ethical person who is using tinder ” “wow ” she replied  “you found the only one ”  this is a bit of an exaggeration – i’m sure several ethical people use tinder – but the fact is  it’s a lot better known for being a tool that people use to be  well  tools  so  thank you for this refreshing request for help in avoiding being a jerk   i think it’s pretty accepted among users of tinder and other dating apps that everyone is seeing several people at once  at least  potentially  until you have a conversation about commitment  so the fact that you have been seeing them both is not the end of the world  however  you say things are getting “kind of serious” with the first woman you’re dating – i don’t know how you qualify “serious” but my reading  without more detail  is that you believe the first woman might feel hurt or betrayed if she learned about the second one  most people wouldn’t feel that way after two dates with someone they met on tinder  but they would after a month and several nights of passion   that you’re asking for permission  so to speak  to keep dating the second woman makes me think your interest in the first one is waning  or is not commensurate with the “kind of serious” nature of your other relationship   you say that you don’t want to miss out on someone who is a better match for you  but these are people we’re talking about  it’s not like you bought two sweaters at a store and are wearing them both around the house before returning one   unless you’re certain that the first woman is a fan of open relationships  i would suggest you break up with her in as kind a way as possible  which is to say  with swiftness and empathy  this may make you feel like a jerk at the time  but is much less jerky than doing it after she spends another month with you   love   evakelly osbourne is definitely not racist  she denounced donald trump on the view – and everyone grabbed the wrong end of the stick  kelly osbourge … we trust this matter is now closed   adventures in celebrity misspeakings  as kelly osbourne opines on donald trump’s racism and everyone gets the wrong end of the stick  last month the us presidential hopeful attacked mexico for “bringing crime  and their rapists” to the us  this week on tv series the view  kelly inquired rhetorically  “if you kick every latino out of this country  then who is going to be cleaning your toilet  donald trump ”  oh dear  clearly  any implication anyone might have divined from this was a massive misapprehension on their part  with disquiet voiced immediately among her view co-hosts  kelly declared  “come on  you know i would never mean it like that ”  is there another way  it would seem so – though as the day wore on  kelly found she did have an apology-esque statement to make  “i will take responsibility for my poor choice of words ” she conceded  “but i will not apologise for being a racist as i am not … i’ve learned a very valuable lesson  it is my hope that this situation will open up a conversation about immigration and the latino community as a whole ”  “by the way ” ran kelly’s upbeat last word on the matter  “i clean my own fucking toilets ”  and if this can also start a conversation on the institutional misunderstanding of entirely benign celebrity comments  then

in a way he does  if we define “best” as batshit crazy and so beyond partridge as to render steve coogan’s character a sort of lovable broadcasting treasure in the harry secombe mould   this week found noel turning his thoughts to the personnel decisions of his former employer once more  in a wide-ranging interview which also touched on the apocalyptic dangers of something called electrosmog   to see noel in action is to feel like you’re watching a high-concept movie in which the protagonist is cursed with being unable to say anything without his inner monologue being transparently revealed  i’d like to see “inner nolly” voiced by bruce willis  like in look who’s talking  but if bruce is unavailable  i think pam ayres would make a decent fist of it  but let’s look at an example  if you can read the following without coming to a conclusion about what noel really feels about new top gear host chris evans  then you are a purer soul than i   “it’s interesting ” noel confides caringly to the daily mirror  “i was a guest on chris’s boat at the monaco grand prix and we had a chat  chris said he wouldn’t touch top gear with a barge pole  he said how tired he was ” noel continues  “and he did look tired  and so i was stunned when within weeks he not only had shown interest but accepted the job  i just hope he’s not taking on too much ”  oof  “he’s a brilliant talent ” noel goes on  “he’s also a mercurial talent in a kenny everett and clarkson mould  he will need to be managed and supported otherwise he could just burn out and make some shocking mistake ” right  any more  “i hope it works out for him  i’m a big fan of his ”  as for other “excellent presenters”  noel has nothing but love for ant and dec  “they’ve been honest  they’ve plundered the house party archive and created  saturday night  takeaway  i take it as a compliment ”  incidentally  despite refusing to pay his licence fee  noel still wants to buy the bbc with a consortium of investors – which i’d have hoped would be as easily achievable as acquiring the commercial rights to gravity  or human suffering  but which is probably becoming more realisable with each month   still  few can deny he has an uncanny gift for futurology  “you could argue that television is dead ” noel explained in 2001  right around the start of an ongoing period widely referred to in the us as the new golden age of television  that gem came in a memorably hilarious interview with the guardian’s simon hattenstone  in which noel also discussed the value of his then-property in devon  “it’s worth a lot more because it’s the largest estate in england without a public right-of-way across it ”  for any who may be confused  noel was not referring to crinkly bottom  the manorial locus of house party  where noel served as the self-styled lord of misrule  some strange tear in the beeb’s fictional continuum saw the same estate which featured in to the manor born – cricket st thomas in somerset – also serve as the setting for construction of that exquisite pink-and-yellow early 90s folly  alas  visitors to the site will now find the blobbyland theme park being reclaimed by nature  “that there was a whole theme park dedicated to mr blobby at all seems inconceivable today ” remarked the western gazette last year  appended was a 2012 youtube clip showing an eerily derelict blobbyland  creepers entwining around its ruins  and strewn with artefacts “including a high chair  toothbrushes  toaster and sofa  all in his trademark pink with yellow spots”   unloved … blobbyland   sic transit gloria nolly  perhaps one day this lost citadel will be discovered by a buccaneering archeologist  who penetrates the complex system of gunge-based booby-traps noel will have laid for meddling raiders  and is able to reach out just in time to grab the ultimate prize – an explanation of the actual point of it all – before it collapses for ever behind him   back in the present day  however  noel has a theory about a-list anti- celebrity walter palmer  the minnesotan dentist who killed the zimbabwean lion named after cecil rhodes – listen  i just type this stuff – and whose reality tv career could be assured if he’d only hurry up with the barbara walters interview and accept his manifest destiny   noel is big on bad karma and negative energy  and judges palmer’s trophy hunting thusly  “i regard that as a massive negative  the individual concerned has to look at his negativity system  people who do these things have an imbalance in their energy system  positivity can be measured scientifically   “the man who shot the lion – this is not a threat  this is science – will have karma  something is going to happen to that guy because what he did was so utterly negative  the energy he poured out left such a big gap  negative energy will pour into him ”  is this a really bad time to bring up that business about the healthy asian bull elephant at cricket st thomas being euthanised so it could make way for blobbyland   probably  after all  noel is the gotcha maestro who lambasts those who can’t take a joke  yet who – along with jimmy savile – threatened to sue chris morris  in edmonds’ case for tricking him into appearing in brass eye   all that remains is for me to urge someone in bbc light entertainment to get back to me on my new programme concept  inspired by the jean claude van damme world cinema classic hard target  trailer line  “businessmen hunt the ultimate prey … man ”   in my version  former bbc celebrities who refused to pay their licence fee would be hunted across some of england’s most beautiful and inaccessible private estates by walter palmer  with mr blobby serving as his loader  come on  auntie  it may not be bake off but it gunges all over traffic cops top five regrets of the dying  a nurse has recorded the most common regrets of the dying  and among the top ones is  i wish i hadn t worked so hard   what would your biggest regret be if this was your last day of life    bronnie ware   writing top five regrets of the dying has brought me to tears    how to die  five positive steps to deal with death   click here to donate to the national council for palliative care  a palliative nurse has recorded the top five regrets of the dying    there was no mention of more sex or bungee jumps  a palliative nurse who has counselled the dying in their last days has revealed the most common regrets we have at the end of our lives  and among the top  from men in particular  is  i wish i hadn t worked so hard    bronnie ware is an australian nurse who spent several years working in palliative care  caring for patients in the last 12 weeks of their lives  she recorded their dying epiphanies in a blog called inspiration and chai  which gathered so much attention that she put her observations into a book called the top five regrets of the dying   ware writes of the phenomenal clarity of vision that people gain at the end of their lives  and how we might learn from their wisdom   when questioned about any regrets they had or anything they would do differently   she says   common themes surfaced again and again    here are the top five regrets of the dying  as witnessed by ware   1  i wish i d had the courage to live a life true to myself  not the life others expected of me    this was the most common regret of all  when people realise that their life is almost over and look back clearly on it  it is easy to see how many dreams have gone unfulfilled  most people had not honoured even a half of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to choices they had made  or not made  health brings a freedom very few realise  until they no longer have it    2  i wish i hadn t worked so hard    this came from every male patient that i nursed  they missed their children s youth and their partner s companionship  women also spoke of this regret  but as most were from an older generation  many of the female patients had not been breadwinners  all of the men i nursed deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence    3  i wish i d had the courage to express my feelings    many people suppressed their feelings in order to keep peace with others  as a result  they settled for a mediocre existence and never became who they were truly capable of becoming  many developed illnesses relating to the bitterness and resentment they carried as a result    4  i wish i had stayed in touch with my friends    often they would not truly realise the full benefits of old friends until their dying weeks and it was not always possible to track them down  many had become so caught up in their own lives that they had let golden friendships slip by over the years  there were many deep regrets about not giving friendships the time and effort that they deserved  everyone misses their friends when they are dying    5  i wish that i had let myself be happier    this is a surprisingly common one  many did not realise until the end that happiness is a choice  they had stayed stuck in old patterns and habits  the so-called  comfort  of familiarity overflowed into their emotions  as well as their physical lives  fear of change had them pretending to others  and to their selves  that they were content  when deep within  they longed to laugh properly and have silliness in their life again    what s your greatest regret so far  and what will you set out to achieve or change before you die my wedding was perfect – and i was fat as hell the whole time  as a fat woman  you are told to disguise  shrink or flatter your body  but i wasn’t going to hide at my wedding – the older i get  the harder it is to depoliticise simple acts  our big day … lindy west and aham get married    aham and i got engaged on my birthday  he took me to dinner  suggested a “quick nightcap” at our neighbourhood bar  and then  surprise  everyone was there – our friends  our families  the kids  four random people who were just trying to get a damn drink on a sunday night without being accidental set dressing in somebody else’s raucous public proposal  sorry  dudes   i was so happy  he took my hand and led me to the back  there was a paper banner that said my name  the bartender made it – we go there a lot   there was a live string duet  i was confused  why was there a sombre cello at my birthday party  why was my boyfriend doing his intense face  wait  it’s almost 10pm on a school night and we’re at a bar – why are the kids here  then it all happened at once  the knee  the ring  the speech  the question  the tears  all the hits  it was a full-blown grand gesture   months later  i asked him why he did it that way – such a big spectacle  such an event  not precisely our style – and i expected something cliched but sweet  like  “i wanted to make sure our community was a part of our marriage ” or  “i wanted everyone to know how much i love you ” instead  his response cracked me up  “one time when you were drunk you told me  ‘if you ever propose to me  don’t do it in the bullshit way that dudes usually treat fat girls  like it’s a secret  or you’re just trying to keep me from leaving you  thin girls get public proposals  like those dudes are winning a fucking prize  fat chicks deserve that  too ’” i probably would have finessed it a bit if i’d been sober  but way to lean in  bossy  drunk past-lindy   it’s not that i’d ever particularly yearned for a grand gesture – the relationship i cherish lives in our tiny private moments  and  as i’d later discover at my bridal shower  i’m surprisingly uncomfortable being the object of public sincerity  – but the older i get and the longer i live in a fat body  the harder it is to depoliticise even simple acts  a public proposal to a publicly valued body might be personally significant  but culturally it shifts nothing  a public proposal to a publicly reviled body is a political statement   i’ve dated men who relished me in private but refused to be seen with me on the street  or who told me  explicitly  that we had no serious future because they were afraid their friends would laugh at them  i’ve been eagerly approached by men who clearly saw me as nothing but an arousingly taboo body type  which i find equally demoralising  other fat people don’t mind  i know – that’s cool  too   i just wanted to be a person  and  if i was lucky  to fall in love with a person – neither in spite of my body nor because of it  once i finally did  i wanted to crystallise that  make it solid  and broadcast it where younger versions of myself could find it   “i grew up assuming that i would never get married ” i wrote back in november  in a piece called why i can’t wait to be a fat bride  “because marriage was for thin women  the kind of women who deserved to be collected  how could i be a bride when i was already what men most feared their wives would become  i was the mise en place for a midlife crisis  i was the ghost of adultery future  at least  that’s what i’d been taught  and that’s why i can’t goddamn wait to be a fat bride ”  and  “when i think back on my teenage self  what i really needed to hear wasn’t that someone might love me one day if i lost enough weight to qualify as human – it was that i was worthy of love now  just as i was  so i’ll be fat on my wedding day  because being fat and happy and in love in public is still a radical act ”  we got married a week ago at my favourite place – a log cabin that my parents bought when i was a few years old and have painstakingly fixed up over the intervening 30 years   my dad didn’t make it to my wedding  but even though i believed that death is a hard return  i can always feel him at the cabin  i walked down the aisle to a recording of him playing someone to watch over me on the piano  my fiance wore a blue plaid suit  a bald eagle flapped over the ceremony  the food was transcendent  my sister’s fondant camellias slid off the cake  someone spilled red wine on one of the beds  i got my period  it poured after a month of uninterrupted sunshine  then abruptly stopped just as we emerged from the tent to dance  a friend of mine got confused about the route to the bathroom and walked into my mom’s bedroom naked  oh  and aham’s 100-year-old great-grandmother had a tiny stroke on the way to the wedding  went to the hospital  got better  and still came and partied  it was a gorgeous  chaotic  loving  perfect day   and i was fat as hell the whole time   as a fat woman  if you ask for help or guidance on almost any topic  what you inevitably hear is some version of “take up less space ” diminish yourself  feeling sick  make your body smaller  can’t find love  make your body smaller  undervalued at work  make your body smaller  can’t make your body smaller  hide your body  can’t hide your body  “flatter” your body  ie make it look smaller   choose an empire waist  cover your arms  your body is too unattractive  your body is too expensive  your body is too unruly  we want to see less of you  or preferably none at all   “the first thing that a plus-size wedding dress must be in the eyes of the wedding-dress industry is ‘flattering’ ” says my friend and wedding planner alithea o’dell  “their primary concern is to hide your body  which is just absurd when you think about how much inspiration and thought and talent goes into designing straight-sized dresses  those dresses can be many things – a show stopper  glamorous  beautiful  delicate  sexy – before they are ‘flattering’ ”  well  i don’t hide any more in my everyday life  and i definitely wasn’t going to hide at my wedding   i skipped the bridal boutiques altogether  my friend  artist and designer mark mitchell  and i conceived of the most beautiful dress we could imagine  which  according to the old orthodoxies  just happened to be the least “flattering” dress possible for a fat chick  a strapless  skin-tight mermaid gown exploding with silk flowers  the flowers – my god  the wisteria  – added extra bulk in areas i’m supposed to try and “slim”  the silhouette accentuated my stomach instead of camouflaging it  my arms looked like what they are – strong  and big  i didn’t wear spanx  i was beautiful   but “beauty” is a fraught concept  there’s an awkward three-way tension between wedding culture and feminism and fat acceptance – because of what “acceptance” demands of women in our culture  a lot of fat activism takes the form of fat women trying to “prove” that they can wear the trappings of male fantasy and traditional gender roles just as well as thin women  fat women can be pretty  fat women can get married  fat women can “get” conventionally attractive husbands  but how is that constructive  male approval isn’t where my self-worth comes from – and that realisation was a huge part of what made my current relationship healthy and fulfilling  respectability politics might boost mainstream attitudes toward fat people in the short-term  but what does it do for women in general in the long-term  how can i simultaneously fight for women to be free of patriarchal standards and for fat women to be allowed to participate in those standards   my short answer is that i am far more interested in expanding the realm of self-expression for fat people than in adding to the already extensive list of what we “can” and “can’t” wear  but i also asked alithea how she reconciles that tension as a wedding planner  a feminist  and a fat woman  “i agree ” she said  “that sometimes women will still internalise these patriarchal ideas we are taught about how we must get married  we must be as beautiful as possible  we must be loved by a cis man  and if we don’t  we aren’t truly happy or successful  obviously  this is bullshit  of course a partner brings us happiness in so many ways that others can’t  but there is a fundamental structure of love  and happiness  and true peace most of us must find in ourselves before we find happiness with a partner  otherwise it’s like a beautiful house built on a shitty foundation  the strongest conflict i navigate is the one between feminism and the capitalism that is so deeply interwoven into weddings  capitalism is not feminist – it is built on preying on cheap labour  by literally enslaving people to manufacture things so other people get rich  the wedding industrial complex has convinced us that the only ‘good’ weddings are the weddings that cost the most  but i see weddings as a tradition  a ceremony  and those things are important in all cultures  so i work with my clients to strip away the gross stuff that doesn’t feel right  the stuff they’re told they ‘need’  and rebuild a wedding into a ceremony and a party that is reflective of their values  something that they are proud of and feels like an honest celebration of their love ”  choose your rituals  but make them yours  if you want to look like a flower market ate fat betty draper and then barfed her up in the middle of a haunted forest  yeeeesss    great choice  if you want to get married to a burrito while wearing a barrel with suspenders  i’m cool with it  if you think the very concept of marriage is hot garbage  that’s legit  but regardless  remember that you absolutely do not have to “fix” your body  chase after “flattering”  be somebody’s dark secret  or beg for permission to be happy   and to my 16-year-old self  if you’re reading this  listen to alithea  she is wise  “when i enter into a relationship  i am not filling a hole that society has dug out of my soul  telling me that i am fat  and because i am fat i am ugly  and because i am ugly i am unlovable  i am there  in their bed and in their life  for the purest of reasons  not because i am insecure and need the external validation that a patriarchal society has taught us to seek  i am not seeking validation from a partner  i am seeking partnership in that partner ”  i have never in my life been fatter than i was on my wedding day  i have never shown my body in such an uncompromising way  and i have never felt more at home in that body  i was fully myself  and i was happy  we are happy  this life is yours  fat girls  eat it up
